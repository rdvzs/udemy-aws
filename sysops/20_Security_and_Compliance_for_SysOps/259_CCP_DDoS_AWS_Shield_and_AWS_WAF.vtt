00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.980
<v Narrator>Now let's talk about</v>

2
00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.650
how we can protect ourselves from a DDoS attack.

3
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.790
A DDoS attack is a Distributed Denial-of-Service attack

4
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.360
on our infrastructure

5
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.890
and we'll see how this works.

6
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:10.980
So say there's an attacker,

7
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.040
that's a hacker

8
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.730
and they want to do a DDoS attack

9
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.660
against our application server.

10
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.080
In this case they're going to launch multiple master servers

11
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.190
and these servers are going to launch bots,

12
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.310
a lot of bots

13
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.170
and all these bots

14
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.920
are going to send a request to our application server.

15
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.630
Now our server is not meant

16
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.060
to handle this many requests

17
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.230
so it will be overwhelmed

18
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.950
and it will not be working anymore,

19
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.400
he will be denied a service

20
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.530
and therefore any normal user trying to connect

21
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.130
to our application server,

22
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.320
will see that our server is not accessible

23
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.500
or not responsive,

24
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.900
effectively making our application down.

25
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.750
So a DDoS attack is quite scary

26
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.700
when you think about it

27
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.180
but on AWS

28
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.670
you can protect yourself from it.

29
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.040
The first way is to use AWS Shield Standard

30
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.700
and that's enabled for all customers at no additional cost

31
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.710
and it will protect you against a DDoS attack

32
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.520
for your websites and application.

33
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.670
If you want a premium DDoS protection,

34
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.610
you have to use AWS Shield Advanced

35
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.350
which is going to give you 24/7

36
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.270
so 24 hours a day,

37
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.860
seven days a week protection on DDoS.

38
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.070
Then you have WAF

39
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.340
to filter specific requests based on rules,

40
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.450
this is the web application firewall.

41
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.180
CloudFront and Route 53 that we've already seen

42
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.570
to give us protection by using the global edge network

43
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.200
and so when it's combined with Shield

44
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.040
it will provide attack mitigation at the edge locations

45
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.210
and finally you need to be ready to scale

46
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.310
if you're under attack

47
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.770
maybe by leveraging auto scaling on AWS.

48
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.640
So here is what the sample reference architecture

49
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.450
looks like for DDoS protection.

50
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.620
So we have our users

51
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.470
and they will be routed through the DNS on Route 53

52
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.030
which is protected by shield

53
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.430
so your DNS is safe from DDoS attack,

54
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.540
then you should use a CloudFront distribution

55
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.990
to make sure your content is cached at the edge

56
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.090
and then it is also protected by shield

57
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.340
and in case you need to filter

58
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.320
and protect from an attack,

59
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.370
you can use the web application firewall,

60
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.800
then to serve that application

61
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.470
you can use a load balancer in the public subnet

62
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.980
that will scale for you

63
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.050
and finally behind the load balancer

64
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.650
you should use EC2 instances

65
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.950
in an auto scaling group

66
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.530
to be able to scale to the higher demand.

67
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.260
So all of this will give you a really good DDoS protection

68
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
against these type of attacks.

69
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.910
Now let's do a deep dive into the services

70
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:19.990
that I just mentioned.

71
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.910
So Shield is made up of two components,

72
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.330
we have Shield Standard

73
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.320
which is a free service

74
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.460
that is activated for every AWS customer

75
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.800
and this will provide you

76
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.860
protection against the common attacks for DDoS,

77
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.830
they're called SYN/UDP Reflection Floods,

78
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.670
Reflection attacks

79
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.050
and other layer three or layer four attacks.

80
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.350
Then you have Shield Advanced

81
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.530
which is an optional service,

82
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.870
it cost you about $3000 per month per organization

83
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.370
and they will give you protection

84
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.300
against more sophisticated attacks

85
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.900
on your EC2, ELB, CloudFront, Global Accelerator

86
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.430
and Route 53.

87
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.590
You also get access to your response team

88
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.550
when you need it

89
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.090
to help you protect yourself

90
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.630
during these DDoS attacks

91
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.790
and in case you are incurring some costs

92
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:01.700
on these attacks,

93
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.810
then any fees that is incurred during this attack

94
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.720
is on AWS.

95
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.640
So Shield from an exam perspective

96
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.580
remember that the free version

97
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.010
is activated by default for every customer

98
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.690
and if you need that response team

99
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.330
if you need to be having a higher level of defense

100
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.190
then Shield Advanced

101
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.380
is something that you enable yourself

102
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.443
and it cost about $3000 per month.

103
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.450
Next we have the Web Application Firewall, so WAF

104
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.700
and this is to protect your web applications

105
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.840
from common web exploits,

106
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.340
for example on layer seven.

107
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.570
Layer seven as you remember

108
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.590
maybe is HTTP

109
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.960
whereas layer four was for TCP.

110
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.450
So because it is layer seven

111
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.820
it can be deployed only on HTTP friendly devices

112
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.950
so it can be deployed on your application load balancer

113
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.490
your API gateway we haven't seen it,

114
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.980
it's out of scope for the exam

115
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.320
and CloudFronts.

116
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.790
On your web application firewall

117
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.490
you can define Web ACL

118
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.540
so Web Access Control Lists

119
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.050
and these rules on this ACL

120
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.910
can include filtering for example

121
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.760
based on the IP addresses,

122
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.790
the headers of HTTP,

123
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.620
the body, some strings

124
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.520
it can protect you against common attacks

125
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.860
such as a SQL injection

126
00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.750
or Cross-Site Scripting.

127
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.380
You can have size constraints

128
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.430
to make sure the requests are not too big

129
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.240
and also block certain countries using a geo-match.

130
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.180
Finally for DDoS protection

131
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.170
you can use Rate-based rules

132
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.490
to count the occurrences of events,

133
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.670
therefore saying that

134
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:23.840
you know a user cannot do

135
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.700
more than five requests per second

136
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.120
and that would help to be protected against a DDoS attack.

137
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.010
So that's it's,

138
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.320
just at a high level remember

139
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.330
that it is a combination of

140
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.630
Shield, WAF, CloudFront, Route 53

141
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.750
they will give you an entire DDoS protection

142
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.560
and again all these service you need to them

143
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.700
at a high level.

144
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.650
So hope that was helpful

145
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.600
and I will see you in the next lecture.
