00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.780
<v Instructor>So now, let's talk about AWS Trusted Advisor.</v>

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.490
So you don't need to install anything.

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.633
It's a service that gives you a high level

4
00:00:07.633 --> 00:00:10.365
account assessment on your account.

5
00:00:10.365 --> 00:00:12.252
It's going to check for a few things

6
00:00:12.252 --> 00:00:14.250
and advise you on them.

7
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.643
So the checks can be, for example,

8
00:00:15.643 --> 00:00:17.995
do you have EBS Public Snapshots?

9
00:00:17.995 --> 00:00:21.270
Or do you have RDS Public Snapshots?

10
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.400
Or are you using the root accounts for your accounts?

11
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.008
So all these things are checked by Trusted Advisor

12
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:30.239
and they are grouped in six categories.

13
00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.540
We have cost optimization, performance,

14
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.239
security, fault tolerance,

15
00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.501
service limits, and operational excellence.

16
00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:43.013
So you have what's called the three sets of checks,

17
00:00:43.013 --> 00:00:44.011
the core sets of checks,

18
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:47.288
and then you have the full set of checks.

19
00:00:47.288 --> 00:00:49.890
And to have access to the full set of checks,

20
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.886
you need to have a business

21
00:00:51.886 --> 00:00:54.900
or an enterprise support plan.

22
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.742
On top of it, if you do switch

23
00:00:55.742 --> 00:00:59.163
on the business and enterprise support plan,

24
00:00:59.163 --> 00:01:00.753
then you get programmatic access

25
00:01:00.753 --> 00:01:05.753
to Trusted Advisor through the AWS Support API.

26
00:01:06.013 --> 00:01:08.377
So I think it's best for you to see what Trusted

27
00:01:08.377 --> 00:01:12.000
Advisor is made of to really understand it.

28
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.499
So here, I am in Trusted Advisor.

29
00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:16.550
And as you can see, you have recommendations.

30
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.972
So zero actions are recommended,

31
00:01:17.972 --> 00:01:20.999
but two investigations are recommended for me,

32
00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:23.506
and then there are some checks on excluded items or not.

33
00:01:23.506 --> 00:01:25.254
But as we can see, we have two

34
00:01:25.254 --> 00:01:28.260
on security that must be looked at.

35
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.384
So it turns out that one of my bucket

36
00:01:30.384 --> 00:01:32.991
is actually allowing a global access.

37
00:01:32.991 --> 00:01:36.287
So I need to verify it and make sure it's correct.

38
00:01:36.287 --> 00:01:40.740
And as you can see, 29 of my 60 security group rules

39
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.250
allow unrestricted access to a specific port.

40
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.133
So again, this is something I should look at.

41
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:48.512
Maybe that's my intention, maybe that's a problem.

42
00:01:48.512 --> 00:01:50.279
But you can see right away,

43
00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:52.479
I get prompted to upgrade my support plan

44
00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.620
to get all Trusted Advisor checks.

45
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.489
So let me show you what I mean.

46
00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:57.570
On the left-hand side,

47
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.910
we have the Recommendation categories.

48
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.280
And if I click on Cost optimization,

49
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.524
as you can see, I get none of the checks available

50
00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:06.487
because I need to update my support plan.

51
00:02:06.487 --> 00:02:10.335
So all these things are actually not available for me

52
00:02:10.335 --> 00:02:11.510
and I need to pay for the service

53
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.430
to actually make some cost optimizations.

54
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.625
Same for performance, I get access to nothing.

55
00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:17.726
If I go to Fault tolerance,

56
00:02:17.726 --> 00:02:19.721
again, I get access to nothing.

57
00:02:19.721 --> 00:02:22.560
Operational excellence, again, access to nothing.

58
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.400
The only two things I have access to is security.

59
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.300
So here, we get some checks, the core checks.

60
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.910
And in here, I have my Bucket Permissions,

61
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.491
my Security Group ports, my EBS Public Snapshot,

62
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:38.190
RDS Public Snapshot, and so on.

63
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.230
But as soon as I go in here

64
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.920
to the more advanced security checks,

65
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.620
then, again, I need to update my support plan.

66
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.453
Finally, you can have a look

67
00:02:47.453 --> 00:02:50.252
at Service limits directly in Trusted Advisor.

68
00:02:50.252 --> 00:02:52.200
That's one way of doing it.

69
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.995
So you can have a look at your Auto Scaling Groups,

70
00:02:53.995 --> 00:02:56.241
your CloudFormation Stacks, your DynamoDB Read

71
00:02:56.241 --> 00:02:58.778
and Write Capacity and so on.

72
00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:01.518
So Trusted Advisor is not a very interesting service

73
00:03:01.518 --> 00:03:03.874
to look at when you don't pay for the support plan,

74
00:03:03.874 --> 00:03:06.520
but at least this should give you an idea

75
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.200
of how Trusted Advisor is used in AWS,

76
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.740
and therefore answer your exam questions on it.

77
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.573
All right, so that's it.

78
00:03:14.573 --> 00:03:15.756
I hope you liked it

79
00:03:15.756 --> 00:03:18.183
and I will see you in the next lecture.
