00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.250
<v Instructor>So now let's talk about a very simple service</v>

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.710
called the AWS Secrets Manager.

3
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.890
So it's a newer service and it's meant for storing secrets

4
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.190
and it's going to be different from the SSM parameter store,

5
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.120
because on Secrets Manager, you have the capability to force

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.060
the rotation of secrets every X number of days,

7
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.330
and therefore you have a better secret management schedule.

8
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.610
On top of it, from within Secrets Manager,

9
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.310
you can force and automate the generation

10
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.170
of secrets on the rotation.

11
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.390
And for this, you have to define a Lambda function

12
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.670
that will generate that new secrets.

13
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.060
Moreover, Secrets Manager is really well integrated

14
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.100
with different services on AWS.

15
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.080
And I just showed you Amazon RDS

16
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.620
for example, for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL or Aurora.

17
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.020
But there are other services as well with AWS,

18
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.850
other databases, that are integrated

19
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.680
with Secrets Manager out of the box.

20
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.230
That means that the username and the password to get into

21
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.410
your database is stored directly in Secrets Manager

22
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.750
and it can be rotated and so on.

23
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.260
Now, Secrets can be encrypted using the KMS service.

24
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.110
And so anytime in the exam you see Secrets,

25
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.090
or integration for RDS,

26
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.200
or for Aurora of Secrets, really think Secrets Manager.

27
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.730
There's one more feature we need to know about

28
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.820
which is the concept of multi-region Secrets.

29
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.340
So the idea is that you can replicate your Secrets

30
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.830
across multiple AWS regions

31
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.500
and Secrets Manager Service will keep readers

32
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.840
in sync with the primary Secrets.

33
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.250
So here have two regions.

34
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.440
We create a Secret in the primary one

35
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.900
and it gets replicated as a same Secret

36
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.090
into a secondary region.

37
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.260
Now, why would we do this?

38
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.790
Well, multiple things.

39
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.020
Number one, in case there is a problem with US East 1,

40
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.930
you're able, for example, to promote a replica Secret

41
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.060
as a standalone secret.

42
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.030
And then thanks to the fact that that Secret is replicated

43
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.600
across regions, then you can build multiple regions apps.

44
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.090
You can also have disaster recovery strategies,

45
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.240
or if you have an RDS database that is also being replicated

46
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.770
from one region to the next,

47
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.200
then you can use the same Secret to access,

48
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.050
the same, the RDS database, the corresponding one,

49
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.880
in the corresponding region.

50
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.260
So that's it for this lecture.

51
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
