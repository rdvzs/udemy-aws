00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.760
<v ->So now let's talk about AWS Artifacts,</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.220
which is not really a service

3
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.060
but it is presented as one in the consult.

4
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:07.893
So what is it?

5
00:00:07.893 --> 00:00:11.100
It is a portal that will give you the customer access

6
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.720
on demand to the compliance reports

7
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.310
and AWS agreements.

8
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.780
So these artifact reports can be downloaded

9
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.790
and they represent a security

10
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.553
and compliance documents from third party auditors,

11
00:00:21.553 --> 00:00:24.050
such as the alias ISO certifications,

12
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.590
the payment card industry.

13
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.610
So PCI reports and the SOC reports.

14
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.460
There's also artifacts agreements

15
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.890
which is allowing you to review,

16
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.830
accept and track the status of alias arguments

17
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.020
such as the BAA agreements

18
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.270
or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act,

19
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.700
which is HIPAA, we'll see this maybe in exempt,

20
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.960
for an individual accounts or in your organization.

21
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.780
And so these reports can be used

22
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.800
to support internal audits capabilities within your company

23
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.370
or complaints needs to show

24
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.023
that your compliance by using the AWS cloud.

25
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.113
So if you go into artifacts for AWS,

26
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.240
as we can see this is a global service

27
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.130
and we can get some of the artifacts.

28
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.290
We can view the reports or view the agreements.

29
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.730
So if I click on the reports,

30
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.650
I can see 61 reports right now that I can download.

31
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.090
For example, I can say,

32
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.020
I really want you to get this report right now.

33
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.500
I'm going to download it,

34
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.360
and I say, okay, I accept the NDA

35
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.870
and then I download this report and here I am,

36
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.930
I have a report that I can use for compliance internally

37
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.360
or also I can go into agreements

38
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.810
and find different agreements.

39
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.750
For example, three account agreements

40
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.720
and we don't have any organization agreements.

41
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.790
So I can take one of these agreements.

42
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.890
For example, this one, the BAA agreements

43
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.570
accept the agreements and then download it,

44
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.200
I scroll down, I accept it and then I download it.

45
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.620
So it's very, very simple.

46
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.760
It's not really a service.

47
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.800
It's a way for you to download compliance documents,

48
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.950
I just want to show you once

49
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.220
and then you have to remember it

50
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.550
and that will be it for this lecture.

51
00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.363
I will see you in the next lecture.
