00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.070
<v Stephane>Okay, so now let's talk about</v>

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.750
penetration testing on the Cloud.

3
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.160
So, penetration testing is when you're trying to attack

4
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.900
your own infrastructure to test your security.

5
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.820
A customer of AWS is welcome

6
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.250
to carry out these security assessments

7
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.380
and penetration testing against your own infrastructure

8
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.440
without prior approval for eight services.

9
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.510
So, our Amazon EC2 instances,

10
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.463
NAT Gateways and Elastic Load Balancers, Amazon RDS,

11
00:00:27.463 --> 00:00:30.680
CloudFront, Aurora, the API Gateways, Lambda,

12
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.250
and Lambda Edge functions,

13
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.680
Lightsail resources and Elastic Beanstalk environments.

14
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.040
The list can increase over time,

15
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.920
but this is not something that you will be tested

16
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.510
on at the exam.

17
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.320
Just remember that you don't need an authorization

18
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.650
for these eight services,

19
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.100
but if you wanted to do other type of activities

20
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.510
that could be prohibited.

21
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.790
For example, you cannot do a DNS zone walking

22
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.590
via Amazon Route 53 Hosted Zone.

23
00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.150
You can not perform a distributed attack on your system,

24
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.421
so you cannot perform a DoS or DDoS or a Simulated DoS

25
00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:04.380
or Simulated DDoS.

26
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.980
You cannot just attack your own infrastructure

27
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.670
with a denial of service.

28
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.150
You can not do port flooding.

29
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.600
You can undo protocol flooding, request flooding,

30
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.330
which are, you know, variants of an attack.

31
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.220
And for any other events,

32
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.710
you need to contact the security team at AWS

33
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.480
to ensure that they can approve it.

34
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.960
If you wanted to read more, you can read more here.

35
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.300
So, from an exam perspective, yes,

36
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.740
you can do pen testing on your Cloud.

37
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.930
Remember that some are authorized,

38
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.480
but anything that looks like an attack such as DDoS attack

39
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.470
or a DNS zone walking or a port flooding is not authorized

40
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.500
because for AWS,

41
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.040
it would seem like you're trying to attack

42
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.140
their infrastructure and they wouldn't like it.

43
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.120
So, I hope that was helpful

44
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.070
and I will see you in the next lecture.
