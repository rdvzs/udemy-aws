00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.410
<v Instructor>So just to help you for the exam</v>

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.410
and to make you understand

3
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.540
what kind of logging is available in AWS.

4
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.090
Here's a short lecture.

5
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.760
So basically, if you want to have compliance requirements,

6
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.570
there's many services that AWS provides logs for.

7
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.890
It could be security logs or audit logs.

8
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.080
So service logs will include CloudTrial

9
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.330
and here we can trace all the API calls

10
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.220
and we've done this as a hands on so we know how that works.

11
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.580
Config rules, where we can track the config

12
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.670
and the compliance over time

13
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.030
and we've seen this as well in the past section.

14
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.320
CloudWatch logs if you want to have full data retention,

15
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.950
so for example, want to log application logs or whatever,

16
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.400
we can do it there.

17
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.470
VPC Flow logs which is to

18
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.680
review the IP traffic within your VPC.

19
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.030
Now we haven't seen VPC for logs in detail just yet

20
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.970
but we'll do it a future section

21
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.620
and we'll see how they work.

22
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.530
There will be ELB Access logs for your load balancers

23
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.740
and they will give you the metadata

24
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.640
of request made to your load balancer

25
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.680
and we've had the chance to look at it.

26
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.610
CloudFront Logs which is to look at the logs

27
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.730
coming straight from CloudFront your web distribution

28
00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.400
against some metadata of access

29
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.550
and it's going to give you the access logs.

30
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.220
Web Application Firewall Logs, so if you enable WAF,

31
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.420
then you get full logging of all the request analyzed

32
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.470
by the service, which is really really nice.

33
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.530
And the cool things is that all these logs,

34
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.860
you can put them in S3 and then

35
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.640
you can analyze them using AWS Athena.

36
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.540
And so that is a very common exam question.

37
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.030
They will say we have this log,

38
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.050
how can we analyze it?

39
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.130
How can we quickly know or explore what happen

40
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.850
to our ELB even though maybe your EC2 instance

41
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.800
were terminated and we lost logs on their machines.

42
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.390
Where we can use Athena plus ELB Access Logs plus S3,

43
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.960
and that's the combination.

44
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.410
So just remember that a lot of services,

45
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.000
and we've seen them in this course,

46
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.810
do provide logs, they are able to put these logs into S3,

47
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.010
and then we've seen how to analyze these log into S3

48
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.990
using Athena, so this is the idea.

49
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.450
If you google Athena analyze CloudFront Logs,

50
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.670
you'll get the query right away.

51
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.003
Same for ELB, same for CloudTrail, etc.

52
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.430
Now also, you should know that if you do put all these

53
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.520
audit and security logs and compliance logs

54
00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.010
and you put them in S3, it is great to

55
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.830
encrypt these logs and then for the bucket

56
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.120
where you put all these logs,

57
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.200
you can control the access using IAM and bucket policies,

58
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.680
and even multi-factor authentication.

59
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.690
Finally, if you need to retain these logs

60
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.430
for a very long time, remember

61
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.470
you need to move these logs to Glacier for cost saving,

62
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.130
or if you need all Glacier vault log then as we've seen,

63
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.410
then we get compliance and saying no one can touch these

64
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.810
logs for maybe seven years, or whatever.

65
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.910
If you're more interested into, basically,

66
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.960
logging and security in AWS, there's a whitepaper

67
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.860
you can read, which is quite interesting.

68
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.693
But this is enough for you to understand

69
00:02:32.693 --> 00:02:35.930
basically the scope of all this logging that exists

70
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.790
in AWS, how we can analyze it, how we should store it,

71
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.250
and how we should have cost saying

72
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.870
and compliance on top of it.

73
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.620
Okay, that's it for this theory lecture,

74
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.170
I will see you in the next one.
