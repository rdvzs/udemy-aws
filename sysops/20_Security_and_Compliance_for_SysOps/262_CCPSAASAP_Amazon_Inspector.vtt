00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
<v Instructor>So now let's talk about Amazon Inspector.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.740
So Amazon Inspector is a service that allows you

3
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.030
to run automated security assessments on a couple of things.

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.490
First of all, on the E2 instances.

5
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.390
So you are going to be leveraging the Systems Manager agent

6
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.360
on your EC2 instances and Amazon Inspector

7
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.670
is going to start to assess the security

8
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.380
of that E2 instance.

9
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.960
It's going to analyze against unintended network

10
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.980
accessibility and also analyze the running operating system

11
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.350
for known vulnerabilities.

12
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.540
This is done continuously.

13
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.120
Then we have also Amazon Inspector

14
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.360
for your Container Images push to Amazon ECR.

15
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.190
For example, your Docker images.

16
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.310
So as your Container Images are being pushed

17
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.220
to Amazon ECR, they will be analyzed

18
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.540
by Amazon Inspector against known vulnerabilities.

19
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.510
And we also have Amazon Inspector for Lambda functions.

20
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.850
So Lambda functions, when they're deployed,

21
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.620
will be analyzed again

22
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.890
by Inspector for software vulnerabilities

23
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.400
in the function code and the package dependencies.

24
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.320
And this assessment happens

25
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.960
as the functions are being deployed.

26
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.020
So once Amazon Inspector is done doing its job,

27
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.640
it can report its findings

28
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.640
into the AWS Security Hub and also send findings

29
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.210
and events of these findings into Amazon EventBridge.

30
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.310
This gives you one way to centrally

31
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.540
see the vulnerabilities running on your infrastructure

32
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.513
and with EventBridge you can run some kind of automations.

33
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.470
So what does Amazon Inspector evaluate?

34
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.900
You have to remember, the Inspector is only

35
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.680
for your running EC2 instances, your Container Images

36
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.740
on Amazon ECR and your Lambda functions.

37
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.480
And it's going to do a continuous scanning

38
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.600
of the infrastructure only when needed.

39
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.800
So it's going to look

40
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.477
at a database of vulnerabilities, so CVE,

41
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.750
for package vulnerability for EC2, ECR and Lambda.

42
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.583
And it's going to look

43
00:02:01.583 --> 00:02:05.190
at network reachability on Amazon EC2

44
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.850
and in case the database of CVE gets updated,

45
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.340
then Amazon Inspector is going to automatically

46
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.720
run again to make sure

47
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.170
that all your infrastructure is tested one more time.

48
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.760
Every time it will run,

49
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.220
a risk score is going to be associated

50
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.700
with all the vulnerabilities for prioritization.

51
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.530
So that's it for Amazon Inspector.

52
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.503
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
