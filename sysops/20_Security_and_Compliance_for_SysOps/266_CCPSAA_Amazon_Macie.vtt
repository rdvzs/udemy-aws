<v Instructor>Now let's talk about Macie.</v>

2
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.650
Macie is a fully managed data security

3
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.470
and data privacy service that will use machine learning

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.360
and pattern matching to discover

5
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.510
and protect your sensitive data in AWS.

6
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.410
More specifically, it will alert you around sensitive data

7
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.320
such as personally identifiable information,

8
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.510
which is named PII.

9
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.440
So very simply, your PII data will be in your S3 buckets

10
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.300
and it will be analyzed by Macie

11
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.903
which will discover what data can be classified as PII.

12
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.690
And then will notify you

13
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.870
through EventBridge of the discoveries.

14
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.800
Then you can have integrations into an SNS topic,

15
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.990
Lambda functions and so on.

16
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.750
So Macie in this instance will be used

17
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.170
to find the sensitive data in your S3 buckets

18
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.270
and that's the only thing it will do.

19
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.070
It's just one click to enable it.

20
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.470
You just specify the S3 buckets you want to have

21
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.790
and that will be it.

22
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.740
So that's it for this lecture, very, very short,

23
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.240
but that's enough on Macie.

24
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.173
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
