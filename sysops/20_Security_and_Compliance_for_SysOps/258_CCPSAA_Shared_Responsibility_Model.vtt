00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.100
<v Instructor>Welcome to this section</v>

2
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.890
on security and compliance.

3
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.161
We're going to start right away with the shared

4
00:00:04.161 --> 00:00:06.750
responsibility model.

5
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.850
So this is something we've seen all along this course,

6
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.730
but now it is time for us to formally introduce it.

7
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.890
So, AWS responsibility is the security of the cloud.

8
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.312
That means that all the infrastructure they provide to you,

9
00:00:18.312 --> 00:00:20.840
that includes the hardware, the software facilities,

10
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.720
networking.

11
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.839
They have to protect it

12
00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:25.881
because this infrastructure will run

13
00:00:25.881 --> 00:00:29.920
all the services that you're using on AWS.

14
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.920
On top of it, any service that is managed by AWS,

15
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.920
such as S3 DynamoDB, RDS, is the responsibility of AWS.

16
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.510
But once they provide a service to you,

17
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.180
then how you use that service is your responsibility.

18
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.060
So for example, as a customer,

19
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.830
you are responsible for the security in the cloud.

20
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.940
So in the instance of EC2 instance, your customer,

21
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.080
so you, is responsible for the management of all the

22
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.040
operating system that includes patching the operating system

23
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.580
and making updates to it.

24
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.920
You must configure the firewall,

25
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.840
so that means that's you Mister Green figure, for example,

26
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.235
the network ACL and the security group,

27
00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:10.939
and also you need to make sure that your EC2 instance has

28
00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.900
the correct IAM information through the use of,

29
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.720
IAM instance role.

30
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.640
Then, we also need to ensure that we

31
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.800
encrypt the application data,

32
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.710
according to our compliance requirements.

33
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.480
Then, there are some controls that are shared.

34
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.054
For example, patch management, configuration management,

35
00:01:26.054 --> 00:01:30.010
awareness and training are both shared between you and AWS.

36
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.530
For example, for batch managements,

37
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.861
if using something like RDS,

38
00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:36.750
then AWS will do the patch management for us.

39
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.480
And if we are using something like EC2 then we have to

40
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.700
patch our operating system,

41
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.140
so the shared control is here.

42
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.788
For example, for awareness and training,

43
00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:46.947
AWS has to train their employees

44
00:01:46.947 --> 00:01:49.660
to use their facilities correctly,

45
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.620
and to make sure they adhere to their security guidelines.

46
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.523
And you have to make sure to train your employees correctly,

47
00:01:55.523 --> 00:01:56.940
to use the cloud,

48
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.350
and doing this training is one of these ways, obviously.

49
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.350
Next, let's look at a detailed technology, for example.

50
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.420
So for RDS,

51
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.027
the responsibility of AWS is to manage the underlying

52
00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:11.080
EC2 instance and to the civil SSH access,

53
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.160
to automate the database patching,

54
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.440
to automate the operating system patching,

55
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.510
and to edit the underlying instance and disk

56
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.950
to guarantee that it functions over time.

57
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.520
Your responsibility as a user of RDS

58
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.470
is to check that the ports,

59
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.350
IP security groups inbound rules

60
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.920
in your database security group are set up correctly.

61
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.710
It's also to make sure that the in-database user creation

62
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.376
and the permission of these users is done the way you want,

63
00:02:34.376 --> 00:02:37.180
and also you need to make sure that if you want to create a

64
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.710
database with or without public access.

65
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.702
And if you wanted to configure a database you could use

66
00:02:41.702 --> 00:02:43.400
parameter groups, for example,

67
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.500
to force only encrypted connections.

68
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.114
Finally, if you wanted to encrypt the data

69
00:02:47.114 --> 00:02:48.728
within the database, it is again,

70
00:02:48.728 --> 00:02:51.223
your responsibility to enable.

71
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.200
Next, for Amazon S3,

72
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.607
The responsibility of AWS is to guarantee you

73
00:02:56.607 --> 00:02:59.070
to get unlimited storage,

74
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.770
to guarantee you to get encryption when you enable it,

75
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.150
and to ensure the separation of data between all your,

76
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.800
all the different customers of AWS.

77
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.980
As well, they need to make sure

78
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.650
that all the employees of AWS can not access your data.

79
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.840
Your responsibility is to configure your bucket

80
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.500
the way you want to make sure

81
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.680
the bucket policy adheres to your standards,

82
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.180
and also to use IAM users and roles accordingly.

83
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.140
And finally, if you want to encrypt your data,

84
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.440
it is your responsibility to enable it and to use the

85
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.670
encryption scheme that works for you.

86
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.860
So, hopefully that makes sense.

87
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.420
Here is a diagram from the website of AWS,

88
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.841
which shows the responsibility in the cloud is a customer

89
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:42.210
and responsibility of the cloud is for AWS.

90
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.939
So as a customer, your data,

91
00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:45.910
the applications, the platform,

92
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.120
identity, and access management is up to you,

93
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.010
operating system, network and firewall configuration,

94
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.843
as well.

95
00:03:50.843 --> 00:03:52.770
Then your client's side data encryption,

96
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.230
your server-side encryption,

97
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.363
and your network traffic protection is all yours.

98
00:03:57.363 --> 00:03:59.990
AWS instead, is responsible for their software,

99
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.260
so their services,

100
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.680
also making sure that the compute, storage, database,

101
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.160
and networking are working correctly when they

102
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.530
provide it to you,

103
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.234
and they're responsible for their hardware

104
00:04:09.234 --> 00:04:11.200
and the global infrastructure.

105
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.740
So the regions, the AZ, and the edge locations.

106
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.100
Hopefully that makes sense because their shared

107
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.150
responsibility comes up at least two to three questions

108
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.310
in your exam.

109
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.091
So understanding what is your responsibility

110
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:25.750
and what is the responsibility of AWS is very important.

111
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.720
I hope that was helpful

112
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.670
and I will see you in the next lecture.
