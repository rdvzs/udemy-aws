1
00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.390
<v Male Speaker>So let's do a demo of the Inspector service</v>

2
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.380
and this is a new iteration of the Inspector service.

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.370
So we get a 15-day trial for accounts new to Inspector

4
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.370
and then you have a Pricing

5
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.650
and the Pricing page is going to be right here.

6
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.100
And it's going to give you some information such

7
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.920
as the fact that you're going to get, for example,

8
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.020
a Pricing Table of $0.09 per image being scanned,

9
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.546
$0.01 per rescan,

10
00:00:26.546 --> 00:00:29.520
and then a cost per instance.

11
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.353
Okay?

12
00:00:30.353 --> 00:00:32.840
So, let's get started with Inspector

13
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.480
and for this we need to enable Service Permissions.

14
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.680
So there's a role.

15
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.020
The role has all these permissions to be able to

16
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.270
do what it needs to do.

17
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.420
So it's quite a lot

18
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.300
but it's only managed by the Inspector service.

19
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.450
So we just click on Enable Inspector

20
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.683
and that role is created for us.

21
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.700
So as we can see, we started Inspector

22
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.150
and a first scan is underway,

23
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.860
but for this I need to have EC2 instances.

24
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.580
So if we refresh this page, as we can see,

25
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.580
it goes into finding vulnerabilities for our ECR containers

26
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.470
finding vulnerabilities for EC2 instances

27
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.290
as well as Network reachability findings for EC2 instances.

28
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.750
Also, the best thing to do is to start an EC2 instance

29
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.920
and let's get started.

30
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.180
So the cool thing about EC2 instances is

31
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.230
that if you launch an instance, okay?

32
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.980
And you use, let's use the new UI by the way

33
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:24.813
just to try it out.

34
00:01:24.813 --> 00:01:29.573
So we use a EC2 instance, I call this Demo EC2 Instance.

35
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.070
What you need to do is just use Amazon Linux

36
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.060
and Amazon Linux Why?

37
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.070
Well, because it comes

38
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.330
with the SSM Agent pre-installed and enabled on it.

39
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.810
So this image is launched.

40
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.060
We're going to use a Free tier eligible image.

41
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.380
We use a t2.micro, and we don't need a key pair and so on.

42
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.260
So I can just scroll down.

43
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.430
We don't need to do anything special.

44
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.760
Let's just launch that instance.

45
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.093
We can proceed without a key pair and be good to go.

46
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.660
Okay. So now the instance is launching.

47
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.390
And as we launch this instance

48
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.830
it is going to be scanned by the Inspector service.

49
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.760
So let me wait, and then I'll get back to you.

50
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.800
So my instance is now running, and if I go into Inspector

51
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.440
and refresh this page, as you can see, there is 0% coverage

52
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.920
but we have 0/1 instances.

53
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.730
So it's been detected, but let's troubleshoot a little bit.

54
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.330
So if I scroll down

55
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.900
and I go to Account Management,

56
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.720
I can see that I have my account enabled for

57
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.590
Amazon Inspector.

58
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.060
And by the way you could Enable Inspector

59
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.480
on your entire organization if you wanted to.

60
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.000
Then under Instances, we have one instance.

61
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.400
We put 0 because we have 0 ECR Repositories.

62
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.900
And then as images

63
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.560
we have 0 ECR container images, to scan.

64
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.670
So Instances we have 1, okay?

65
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.960
But Scanning 0, Not Scanning 1.

66
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.390
So the thing is, if we look at this instance and have a look

67
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.510
at it we scrolled right, it says "Unmanaged EC2 Instance."

68
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.210
So somehow something is wrong with this instance.

69
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.447
And so what we can do is click on this and it says

70
00:02:59.447 --> 00:03:02.660
"follow these instructions to remediate the issue".

71
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.380
So we're going to follow these instructions,

72
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.180
and it takes me straight into the Systems Manager page.

73
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.120
And there is

74
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.240
a AWSSupport-TroubleshootManagedInstance document,

75
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.350
An Automation that we can run,

76
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.780
and we need to provide the Instance Id.

77
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.490
So to do so let's copy the Instance Id

78
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.010
and figure out what is wrong with it.

79
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.987
So we're going to execute this

80
00:03:24.987 --> 00:03:28.930
and we're going to wait until we get the results.

81
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.490
And so it turns out that the instance is online.

82
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.480
So Ping Status is good

83
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.180
but then the GetEC2InstanceProperties fails.

84
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.230
And then the rest

85
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.590
of these things aws:executeScript are Pending.

86
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.750
And so I know what the issue is, of course.

87
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.263
So if you go into Systems Manager, I go in Quick Setup.

88
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.470
And then in Quick Setup, I'm going to get started.

89
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.270
So, we choose a home region for eu-west-1

90
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.770
which is where I am.

91
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.650
And it's going to create the Instance Roles

92
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.600
for me and everything that's needed, and then attach them

93
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.440
to my EC2 instances so that they are properly registered

94
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.970
within the AWS Systems Manager.

95
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.890
So we are going to do Host Management and

96
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.200
as we'll just click on it, and then we'll update the agent

97
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.200
we'll collect inventories kinda instances

98
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.240
and then we are good to go.

99
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.170
The targets are all the instances within my region.

100
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.323
Let's click on Create.

101
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.260
And now we just wait.

102
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.820
So, my Host Management Quick Setup was completed.

103
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.123
And then if we go into our Fleet Manager,

104
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.960
we can see that my instance is being detected by SSM.

105
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.250
So now this is good.

106
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.410
And if I go to my instance and refresh it

107
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.350
I can have a look at the Security tab.

108
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.170
And the fact that yes, an IAM Role was attached

109
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.160
to my instance to be registering it within SSM.

110
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.130
So back in Inspector

111
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.080
if I refresh this page and look at my instances

112
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.980
we can see that my Demo Instance is detected

113
00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.190
and now it is in state scanning.

114
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.920
So it is continuously being monitored by Inspector.

115
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.810
And what I need to do now is just wait

116
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.610
for it to find vulnerability.

117
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.890
So as we can see, right now 0 critical findings

118
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.470
but I'm going to pause and come back to you in a few hours.

119
00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.890
So I let it run for the whole weekend.

120
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.990
And there are no critical findings, which is good news

121
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.880
because I'm using an Amazon Linux AMI.

122
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.210
And I think they fix most of the issues.

123
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.240
But if you scroll down, you see, they have image

124
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.410
with most critical findings.

125
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.460
And they are all two findings in here.

126
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.450
So if I go into this EC2 Instance has been scanned.

127
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.330
There's been 1 Medium finding, which is something.

128
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.150
And that is that the port reachable,

129
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.250
the port 22 is reachable from an Internal Gateway.

130
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.260
So this is a security group issue,

131
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.130
and it's a Network Reachability type of issue.

132
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.440
So that's it for Inspector.

133
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.440
Obviously you get more findings, the more you run it.

134
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.330
And the more instances you have and the more stuff

135
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.590
you install onto your instances,

136
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.180
but I hope that was helpful.

137
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.750
And to finish, you need to just go into General

138
00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.050
and Disable Inspector, because then

139
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.640
you will be billed after 14 days, and then

140
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.240
don't forget as well to terminate

141
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.190
your EC2 instance if you had one.

142
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.750
Okay, that's just for this lecture.

143
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:11.700
I hope you liked it.

144
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.733
And I will see you in the next lecture.
