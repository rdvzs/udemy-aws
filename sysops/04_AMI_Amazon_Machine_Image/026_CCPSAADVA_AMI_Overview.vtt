00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.173
<v Instuctor>Now let's talk about</v>

2
00:00:01.173 --> 00:00:04.140
what powers our EC2 instances which is an AMI,

3
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.280
so AMI stands for Amazon machine image

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.890
and they represent a customization of an EC2 instance.

5
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.930
So you can use AMIs you created by AWS

6
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.520
or you can customize it into your own and what is in an AMI?

7
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.500
Well we have our own software configuration,

8
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.470
we can define and set up the operating system,

9
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.510
we can set up any monitoring tool

10
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.320
and if we create our own AMI

11
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.670
we're going to get a faster boot time and configuration time

12
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.750
because all the software that we want to install

13
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.370
onto our EC2 instance

14
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.520
is going to be prepackaged through the AMI.

15
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.330
So we have to build our own AMIs

16
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.060
and they can be built for a specific region

17
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.370
and then they can be copied across region

18
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.430
if we wanted to use it

19
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.810
and leverage the AWS global infrastructure.

20
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.730
So we can launch EC2 instances from different kind of AMIs.

21
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.570
What we've been doing so far in this course

22
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.840
is to use a public AMI and these are provided by AWS.

23
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.070
So the Amazon Linux 2 AMI is a very popular AMI for AWS

24
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.860
and it was provided by AWS themselves

25
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.310
but we can create our own AMI

26
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.170
then therefore you have to make and maintain them yourself

27
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.630
there are tools obviously to automate this

28
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.630
but this is a task that you have to do as a cloud user

29
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.670
or finally you can launch an EC2 instance

30
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.120
from an AWS Marketplace AMI

31
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.950
which is an AMI that has been made by someone else

32
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.040
and potentially sold by someone else

33
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.430
so it is quite common to have vendors on AWS

34
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.420
to create their own AMIs or their own software

35
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.160
with a nice configuration and so on

36
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.410
and then they will sell it through the marketplace AMI

37
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.060
for you to buy it and to save some time.

38
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.170
And even you as a user you could create a business

39
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.080
of selling AMIs on the AWS marketplace,

40
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.200
this is something that some businesses do.

41
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.960
Okay so the AMI process from an EC2 instance,

42
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.830
how does it work?

43
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.620
Well we'll start an EC2 instance and we'll customize it.

44
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.430
Then we will stop the instance

45
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.010
to make sure the data integrity is correct,

46
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.410
then we can build an AMI from it

47
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.700
so this will also create EBS snapshots behind the scenes

48
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.380
and then finally we can launch instances from other AMIs

49
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.680
so this is what we'll be doing

50
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.720
in the demo and the next lecture.

51
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.430
So we have US-EAST-1A,

52
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.387
and we can create the same instance as US-EAST-1B,

53
00:02:24.387 --> 00:02:27.940
so the process is we launch the instance in US-EAST-1A,

54
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.490
we're going to customize it

55
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.647
then we're going to create an AMI from it

56
00:02:31.647 --> 00:02:34.280
this will be our custom AMI.

57
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.900
And then in US-EAST-1B

58
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.070
we will be able to launch from that AMI

59
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.300
and we'll effectively create a copy of our EC2 instance.

60
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.410
So I hope you're excited

61
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.360
and I will see you in the next lecture.
