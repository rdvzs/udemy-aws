00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.180
<v Instructor>So let's go ahead and practice using AMX.</v>

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.970
For this, I'm going to launch an instance,

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.380
and I'm going to go into this new experience.

4
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.140
So I will scroll down.

5
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.650
We'll choose Amazon Linux 2.

6
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.290
I will scroll down again.

7
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.420
We'll use the G2 micro.

8
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.300
I will select the easy to draw as my key pair

9
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.670
but it doesn't really matter.

10
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.070
Then I will scroll down.

11
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.600
I would edit the network settings

12
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.170
and I will select an existing security group

13
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.733
being my launch wizard one from before.

14
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.340
Then we'll have the same storage and for advanced details,

15
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.520
I will scroll down and I will go for user data,

16
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.280
but this time you're going to copy everything,

17
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.070
but the last line.

18
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.360
So, in the first four lines, we actually install HTTPD

19
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.140
which is the Apache web server.

20
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.650
In the last line, we create an index file

21
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.750
but right now we don't want to create an index file

22
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.852
want to do everything but that to create an AMI out of it.

23
00:00:55.852 --> 00:00:57.860
So we just copy everything.

24
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.940
Remember, the last line is the system CTL command.

25
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.163
And then we launch our instance.

26
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.760
So our instance is launched and what's going to happen is

27
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.480
that the instance is going to launch that's right here.

28
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.270
And then it's going to run

29
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.583
through the EC two, using the script

30
00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:19.330
and it's going to install the Apache web server.

31
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.870
So if I'm too quick

32
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.890
and I try to open right now, this public IPV four

33
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.420
and try to enter into it, as you can see, it doesn't work.

34
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.580
I'll get a connection, error, refused and so on.

35
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.200
I need to make sure I'm also using the HTTP protocol,

36
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.910
of course, but it, it just won't work, right?

37
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.430
Because you need to give it a bit of time.

38
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.210
Even if it says 'running', you need to give it time

39
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.830
for the EC two user data script to run for the first time.

40
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.030
So this might take a minute.

41
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.070
This might take two minutes.

42
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.580
Okay. But don't be in a rush, just wait for it to be done.

43
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.660
And then at some point when you refresh

44
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.730
you will see the screen.

45
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.230
So let me pause the video.

46
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.720
And it took about two minutes, but now I have my test page

47
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.310
and this is the basic page from the Apache web server.

48
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.510
And therefore we are good to go.

49
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.280
So what we're going to do out of it is we're going to

50
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.900
create an AMI because we want to just save the state

51
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.210
of our EC two instance and reuse that.

52
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.010
So I right click and I will do image and templates

53
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.320
and then I will create an image.

54
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.370
So we'll call this one 'demo image'

55
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.270
and we're going to create our own AMI.

56
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.470
And then we have these settings right here.

57
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.600
We'll just leave it as is.

58
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.210
Go here and click on create image.

59
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.530
So now what's going to happen is that

60
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.180
an AMI is going to be created.

61
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.660
So if I go to the left-hand side and click on AMI's,

62
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.830
as we can see here, my demo AMI is registered.

63
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.930
And right now the status is pending

64
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.020
because it is being created.

65
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.765
So what I need to do is to be a little bit patient and

66
00:02:49.765 --> 00:02:52.950
for it to go into the created state.

67
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.320
So my Amazon AMI is now created.

68
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.710
And what I can do now is I can launch instances

69
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.090
from this AMI by clicking here.

70
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.410
Or if you are in the instance creation page,

71
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.763
we can launch instances.

72
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.128
And this one is called 'From AMI'.

73
00:03:08.128 --> 00:03:10.220
And in here in the quick start

74
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.790
we get access to the ones we know

75
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.110
but you can also go into the 'my AMI's tab'.

76
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.791
Okay. And you have the ones owned by me

77
00:03:16.791 --> 00:03:19.250
and you can choose the demo image that you just created

78
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.430
from before.

79
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.850
So in that case, you scroll down, you select

80
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.560
to key pair or not, just up to you.

81
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.530
Network settings, again,

82
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.870
we edit them and we just select the existing launchers

83
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.693
in one security group.

84
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.450
And what I'm going to do is that in the advanced,

85
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.050
at the very bottom, I'm going to enter some user data.

86
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.660
So I copy the first three lines, okay.

87
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.680
Which are starting with the hash.

88
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.880
And then the last line, which is the echo on the new line.

89
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.125
And so what we do is that we only just write a new file.

90
00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:53.950
So we don't need to reinstall HTTPD

91
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.890
because this AMI already contains HTTPD

92
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.293
which is why we will speed up in the boot up time.

93
00:04:00.293 --> 00:04:02.580
This is why you would create an AMI.

94
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.760
So we launch an instance and now the instance is launched.

95
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.530
So I can just click on it.

96
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.497
This is the one from the AMI.

97
00:04:09.497 --> 00:04:13.123
I need to wait for it to be fully created.

98
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.720
My instance from my AMI is now running.

99
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.010
I take the public IP address

100
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.820
and then I see the 'Hello World' from this.

101
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.580
And as you can see, this was much quicker

102
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.940
because we didn't have to install HTTPD again.

103
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.640
So this is the whole power of AMI's.

104
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.820
And you can imagine, well, it could be just more than that.

105
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.710
It could be security software,

106
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.840
a lot of prerequisite software, and so on,

107
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.350
you install it, it maybe it takes two,

108
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.560
three minutes to do it.

109
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.440
Then you package it as an AMI,

110
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.350
and then you just start from the AMI,

111
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.090
maybe do some end customization at the end

112
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.430
but you have a much faster boot-up.

113
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.650
And you're good to go.

114
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.010
So that's it for this demo.

115
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.400
Now to get back from this

116
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.970
what you do is that you take your two instances

117
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.795
and you can terminate them.

118
00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:57.110
And that's it.

119
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.860
I will see you in the next lecture.
