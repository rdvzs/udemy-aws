00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.040
<v Instructor>Okay, so let's talk about</v>

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.750
a new service that I really like

3
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.910
and that does come up in the exam now.

4
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.760
It is called EC2 Image Builder.

5
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.040
It is used to automate the creation

6
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.820
of virtual machines or container images.

7
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.040
Quickly, what does that mean for the exam?

8
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.130
That means that you're gonna be able with EC2 Image Builder

9
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.470
to automate the creation, maintain,

10
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.470
validate and test AMIs for EC2 instances.

11
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.920
So let's have a look at diagram

12
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.050
to see how that works in detail.

13
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.840
So we have the EC2 Image Builder service

14
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.420
and it is automatically, when it's going to run,

15
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.850
it is going to create an EC2 instance

16
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.710
called a Builder EC2 instance,

17
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.730
and that EC2 instance is going to build components

18
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.710
and customize the software, for example,

19
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.487
install Java, update the CLI,

20
00:00:49.487 --> 00:00:52.800
update the software system, maybe install firewalls,

21
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.680
whatever you define to happen on that EC2 instance,

22
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.510
maybe install your application.

23
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.400
And then once this is done,

24
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.290
then an AMI is going to be created out of that EC2 instance,

25
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.723
but all of this is obviously automated.

26
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.440
Then the AMI is created, but we want to validate it.

27
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.100
So EC2 Image Builder will automatically create

28
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.640
a test EC2 instance from that AMI

29
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.770
and going to run a bunch of tests

30
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.930
that you are defining in advance.

31
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.010
And if you don't wanna run any tests,

32
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.380
obviously you can just skip that test,

33
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.780
but the test can be asking,

34
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.090
is the AMI working, is it secure?

35
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.040
Is my application running correctly?

36
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.420
All these kinds of things.

37
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.600
And then once the AMI is tested,

38
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.150
then the AMI is going to be distributed.

39
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.510
So while EC2 Image Builder is original service,

40
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.300
it is possible for you to take that AMI

41
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.090
and distribute it to multiple regions,

42
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.530
therefor allowing your application

43
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.843
and your workflow to be truly global.

44
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.910
Next, EC2 Image Builder can be run on a schedule.

45
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.860
So you can define a weekly schedule

46
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.890
or you can say you can run whenever packages are updated

47
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.530
or you can run it manually, et cetera, et cetera.

48
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.120
And it is a free service,

49
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.570
so you're only going to pay for the underlying resources.

50
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.530
What does that mean?

51
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.780
Well, that means that if you create

52
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.780
an EC2 instance during this process

53
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.410
and EC2 Image Builder will create these EC2 instances,

54
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.990
then you're going to pay for these EC2 instances

55
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.510
and when the AMI is created and distributed,

56
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.090
you're going to pay for the storage of that AMI

57
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.130
wherever it has been created

58
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.170
and wherever it has been distributed,

59
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.550
but that should make sense, right?

60
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.450
So I will see you in the next lecture.
