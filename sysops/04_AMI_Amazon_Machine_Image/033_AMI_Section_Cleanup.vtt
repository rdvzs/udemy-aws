<v Instructor>In order to clean up that section,</v>

2
00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.210
take your instance and terminate it, okay?

3
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.930
And also if you wanted to terminate, delete your AMI,

4
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.080
so you can take that demo image and you would deregister it,

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.540
which should remove that AMI, okay?

6
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.460
And in the backend there has been a snapshots been created.

7
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.960
So, if you go to the snapshots,

8
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.400
which is the snapshot that was backing my AMI,

9
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.860
you can delete the snapshots and you'll be good to go.

10
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.070
So, that's it for the cleanup of the AMI section.

11
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.903
I hope you liked it.

12
00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:30.590
And I will see you in the next section.
