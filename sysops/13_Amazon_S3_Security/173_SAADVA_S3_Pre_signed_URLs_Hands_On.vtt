00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.720
<v Instructor>Okay, so let's demonstrate S3 pre-signed URL.</v>

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.600
And I'm just going to take

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.930
one bucket that I know is not public.

4
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.890
And so I click on my coffee.jpg for example,

5
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.690
you can take whatever image you want.

6
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:11.640
And so, let's have a look.

7
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.700
So, we know that this image is private

8
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.270
because if I go and click on my object URL right here,

9
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.440
I get an access denied.

10
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.020
So, this public URL right here

11
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.270
is not working because my bucket is not public.

12
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.130
But, I know that if I clicked on open right here,

13
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.680
it's going to open a new tab

14
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.970
and my image is still showing, why?

15
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.940
Well, because the beginning is exactly the same as before,

16
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.420
but then in here all the way,

17
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.740
you have what's called a pre-signed URL.

18
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.740
And so this URL was pre-signed with my credentials

19
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.420
which allowed me to access this image.

20
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.370
And so the idea is how do we generate

21
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.460
pre-signed URLs for everyone?

22
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.950
So two options, number one, you can use a CLI

23
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.590
and the other option is now to do it

24
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.430
from the console itself.

25
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.140
So, if you click on object action,

26
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.650
you can click on share a pre-signed URL.

27
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.540
And now, it says that anyone can access the object

28
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.630
with this URL until it expires,

29
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.620
even if the bucket and object are private.

30
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.450
So we're saying, "Hey, I want to have this image

31
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.530
and I want to allow minutes or hours."

32
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.730
So I will say, "Hey, it's going to be valid

33
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.170
for the next five minutes."

34
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.090
And then click on create pre-signed URL.

35
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.030
Now it has been created and I can share this URL with anyone

36
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.100
and they will be able to enter it, press Enter

37
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.240
and voila, get access to your image.

38
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.660
So, that's very handy if you want to share access

39
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.260
to some files in your S3 bucket very quickly

40
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.060
and then make sure that the URL expires

41
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.930
for maximum security.

42
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.240
Okay, that's it.

43
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.190
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
