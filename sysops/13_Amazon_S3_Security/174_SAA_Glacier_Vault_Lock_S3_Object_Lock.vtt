00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.840
<v Narrator>So now let's talk about S3 Glacier Vault Lock.</v>

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.680
So the idea is that you want to lock your Glacier Vault

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.180
to adapt a WORM model.

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.000
That means Write Once Read Many.

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.700
So the idea is that you take an object,

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.790
you put it into your S3 Glacier Vault,

7
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.170
and then you lock it so it cannot

8
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.710
be ever modified or deleted.

9
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.960
So for this, you need to create a Vault Lock

10
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.570
Policy on top of your Glacier

11
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.050
and then you lock the policy itself for future edits.

12
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.330
That means that once you've set a Vault Lock

13
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.220
Policy and you locked it,

14
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.730
it can no longer be changed or deleted by anyone

15
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.580
which is very helpful for compliance and data retention.

16
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.510
So that means that once an object is inserted into your

17
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.460
Glacier vault and the vault itself has a Vault Lock Policy

18
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.530
then the object can never be deleted

19
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.730
and even by administrator or AWS or whatever you want.

20
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.890
So it's very helpful for anything legal

21
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.530
such as compliance or data retention.

22
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.910
So that's for the Glacier option.

23
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.340
And it's quite simple to understand.

24
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.850
Now, there is the same option or something similar at least

25
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.660
for the S3 buckets, but it's a bit more complicated.

26
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.440
So for enabling S3 Object Lock,

27
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.750
you must first enable versioning.

28
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.590
And again, it allows you to adapt a WORM model, okay?

29
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.080
But this time it's not a lock policy

30
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.180
at the whole S3 bucket level.

31
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.180
It is a lock you can adapt for each and every object

32
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.080
within your bucket.

33
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.780
So you can do an object lock on the single object.

34
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.810
And the idea is that thanks to an S3 object lock,

35
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.500
you want to block a specific object version to be deleted

36
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.050
for a specified amount of time.

37
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.570
So we have two retention modes.

38
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.180
And the first one is the compliance mode.

39
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.000
The compliance mode looks a lot like what we had

40
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.740
for S3 Glacier Vault Lock.

41
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.860
So the idea is that the object versions cannot be

42
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.590
overwritten or deleted by any user,

43
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.820
including the root user.

44
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.460
So that means that once you are in your compliance mode,

45
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.230
no one can change anything.

46
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.713
And also the retention modes themselves cannot be changed

47
00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:12.450
and the retention period cannot be shortened.

48
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.360
So it's when you wanna be super compliance.

49
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.700
But if you want to be a bit more flexibility

50
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.070
you have the Governance Retention mode.

51
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.580
So in this case, most user cannot override or delete

52
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.220
an object version or alter its lock settings.

53
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.650
But some users, the admin users,

54
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.280
have special permissions and that's given through IAM

55
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.070
and they can change the retention or delete

56
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.450
an object directly.

57
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.450
So compliance is very strict as a retention mode.

58
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.760
Whereas government's is a bit more lenient

59
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.280
and some users have had admin powers

60
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.620
and can change a few things.

61
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.640
Now, in both these modes you have to set a retention period.

62
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.370
That means that you can either apply the compliance

63
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.980
or the governance mode with a retention period

64
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.770
to say that you want to protect the object for

65
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.780
a fixed period of time.

66
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.880
And that period of time can be extended,

67
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.440
if you wanted to.

68
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.480
Now, there is one more thing you can do

69
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.140
with the S3 object log, it's to pull the legal hold

70
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.973
on an object.

71
00:03:10.973 --> 00:03:12.480
So this is different from what we saw.

72
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.300
So legal hold protects any object

73
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.000
on your S3 bucket indefinitely

74
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.770
and that's independent from the retention period.

75
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.870
So once you place a legal hold on an object

76
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.914
think of like, oh, this object is very important.

77
00:03:24.914 --> 00:03:26.580
We need to use it in a trial.

78
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.470
Let's place a legal hold on it.

79
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.660
Then the object is protected forever

80
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.683
regardless of what retention mode

81
00:03:32.683 --> 00:03:36.120
and retention period you've set on it from before.

82
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.720
And then someone who has the IAM permissions

83
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.809
S3 PutObjectLegalHold has the option to take any objects

84
00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:47.850
and put legal holds on them or to remove them.

85
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.880
So this is a flexible mode where you can say, hey,

86
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.550
when someone wants to protect an object in admin,

87
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.100
they use the PutObjectLegalHold permission.

88
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.880
And then once, for example, a legal investigation is over

89
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.400
then it gets removed again using this

90
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.530
PutObjectLegalHold IAM permissions.

91
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.363
Okay.

92
00:04:05.363 --> 00:04:07.530
So you need to know the differences

93
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.111
of the S3 object lock going at the exam.

94
00:04:10.111 --> 00:04:11.640
So I hope you liked it.

95
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.590
And I will see you in the next lecture.
