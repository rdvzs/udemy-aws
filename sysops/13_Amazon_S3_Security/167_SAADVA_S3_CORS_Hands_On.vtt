1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.710
<v Instructor>So let's practice using CORS.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.430
And for this we first must change the index.html files.

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.368
So if you open it,

4
00:00:06.368 --> 00:00:09.420
you will find that this part has been commented out

5
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.730
and this part is to demo CORS.

6
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.370
Okay, so the way to just make it work

7
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.440
is that you first go to line 13

8
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.470
and you remove the first characters before the div.

9
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.463
And after script,

10
00:00:21.764 --> 00:00:25.140
you remove as well the dash, dash and arrow.

11
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.850
So this is going to enable CORS.

12
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.170
And what's going to happen is that

13
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.910
my first webpage is now gonna say

14
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.840
Hello world I love coffee

15
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.250
and show the coffee image.

16
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.830
But after this, we're going to have a script

17
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.110
that is going to fetch an extra page,

18
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.120
an extra HTML page, okay?

19
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.040
And then displays underneath.

20
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.100
And this extra HTML page right here is saying

21
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.310
this extra page has been successfully loaded.

22
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.220
So let's go into our buckets

23
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.020
and we're going to upload two files.

24
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.100
So we have the extra-page.html and the index.html.

25
00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.700
So we're going to do

26
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.253
is that we're going to upload these two files now,

27
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.740
because this is successful.

28
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.470
And if I go into my Properties

29
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.160
and look for my endpoints right here,

30
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.410
I can click on this to open in a new tab.

31
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.540
And we have I love coffee, Hello world! The coffee image.

32
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.720
And then this extra page has been successfully loaded.

33
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.840
So that means that the fetch request worked

34
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.430
from within the same origin

35
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.770
because, well, both my extra page

36
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.150
and my index.html files are on the same bucket.

37
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.890
So now let's demonstrate CORS.

38
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.850
And to do this,

39
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.430
I must first create another extra extra bucket

40
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.500
and enable it as a website.

41
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.030
So let's create a bucket and call it

42
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.030
demo-other-origin-stephane.

43
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.730
And I will choose it to be in another region, for example,

44
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.860
to demonstrate that there are very different servers.

45
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.950
For example, I will put this one in Canada.

46
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.750
Okay, so I'll scroll down.

47
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.820
I will unblock all public access

48
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.890
because we will make this public.

49
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.893
And then I will scroll down, create this bucket.

50
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.943
Now I go into the bucket itself.

51
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.290
And then under Properties I will scroll down

52
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.780
and make sure that we have enabled this as a website.

53
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.618
So yes, this is a website

54
00:02:14.618 --> 00:02:17.160
and I wanna host a static website.

55
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.350
And then we'll say index.html,

56
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.580
even though we don't have one,

57
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.370
this will be enough for the index documents.

58
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.020
Okay, so this is good.

59
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.780
Next, we need to make this bucket public.

60
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.730
So let's go into Permissions.

61
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.840
And then for the bucket policy, let's edit it, okay.

62
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.890
And to make it simple,

63
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.930
I'm going to just copy the one I had from before.

64
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.110
So this one is going to be copied here and pasted,

65
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.960
and I will just swap out the buckets ARN,

66
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.820
right here under the resource.

67
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.320
So this is effectively going to make

68
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.600
these buckets public as well.

69
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.060
So let's save these changes.

70
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.560
And we have an unexpected response

71
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.933
because we just removed the first character.

72
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.440
Save the changes. Perfect.

73
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.350
Back in here, we are going to now upload,

74
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.770
in my other-origin, we're going to upload a file.

75
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.803
So we're going to upload this extra-page.html.

76
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.000
Upload it, and we're good.

77
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.160
So this file should now be a public file

78
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.160
on my buckets enabled as a website.

79
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.373
So if I click on this, this Object URL right here,

80
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.970
as we can see the extra page has been loaded

81
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.100
and the file is public.

82
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.933
So now what we have

83
00:03:26.933 --> 00:03:31.170
is that we have the origin buckets in here

84
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.630
and we can remove this extra-page.html

85
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.540
because we don't need this one right now

86
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.880
because we have placed it in another bucket.

87
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.570
And then we're going to have to change the index.html file

88
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.570
to point instead to the extra page in my other origin.

89
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.860
So first, let's go to this page,

90
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.930
and I'm going to refresh this.

91
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.090
And I get a "404 Not Found" because, well,

92
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.240
we cannot find the extra-page.html.

93
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.320
So this is perfect.

94
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.590
Right now we shows that we have something to fix.

95
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.700
So let's close this.

96
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.960
Let's go to this demo-origin-stephane, other-origin.

97
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.460
Let's go to the properties, find the public URL, this one.

98
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.460
So let's open this as an STS website,

99
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.050
/extra-page.html.

100
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.380
So perfect, we have this extra page, this puzzle website.

101
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.700
And we'll use this entire URL and change our index.html.

102
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.690
And this time to fetch, we're going to fetch not this

103
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.130
but the full path to my extra-page.html on another bucket.

104
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.450
And this is going to trigger

105
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.900
across origin resource share request.

106
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.120
So now I need to re-upload this index.html file

107
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.083
where I need to.

108
00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:44.490
So let's upload it here on the main buckets,

109
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.323
the first one.

110
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.473
Perfect. And let's override it.

111
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.250
Okay, so now my file is uploaded.

112
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.040
So let's go onto my first webpage right now.

113
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.020
And it's using the new index.html.

114
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.800
And I'm going to first open, under More tools,

115
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.590
I'm going to open the web developer tools.

116
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.930
This is something also called the Chrome Developer Tools.

117
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.100
And I'm going to refresh this page

118
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.750
to see if we have an error.

119
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.370
So let's refresh this page.

120
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.710
As you can see now, we don't have any error message here,

121
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.440
but in my console log debugger,

122
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.120
we have something that is written very, very small

123
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.953
and may be aware.

124
00:05:18.953 --> 00:05:21.510
But it says cross-origin request blocked

125
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.730
because the policy does not allow this.

126
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:24.870
There's a CORS header called

127
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.840
the Access-Control-Allow that is missing.

128
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.220
And so therefore, currently,

129
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.400
because my request is going onto this other bucket,

130
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.220
but this other bucket is not set up for CORS yet,

131
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.570
then this request is failing.

132
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.770
And the web browser is saying

133
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.410
that the cross-origin request has been blocked.

134
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.630
So let's fix this by adding the CORS setting.

135
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.710
So let's go here under my other origin, okay,

136
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.440
and you go under Permissions, scroll down,

137
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.610
and we have the CORS setting here that we define in JSON.

138
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.990
So let's edit this.

139
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.790
And we need to add the correct CORS setting.

140
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.500
So thankfully I have them here.

141
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.420
So you just copy this block of code and you paste it here.

142
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.030
And here, the AllowedOrigins we need to define

143
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.360
are going to be a URL of the first bucket with http

144
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.580
without a slash at the end.

145
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.540
So fair lazy.

146
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.770
Let's go to my first web page.

147
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.810
We copy this entirely,

148
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.420
we paste it here,

149
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.850
and if there's a slash at the end like right now,

150
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.110
just remove it.

151
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.960
And then you're going to save these CORS settings.

152
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.690
So now we're saying to this other origin that's, yes

153
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.540
it's okay to make requests from the first origin.

154
00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.100
So how do we know that it's going to work?

155
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.113
Well, let's refresh this page now.

156
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:35.963
As we can see now,

157
00:06:35.963 --> 00:06:37.950
this extra pet has been successfully loaded,

158
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.262
and that's correct.

159
00:06:39.262 --> 00:06:40.980
And we can also have a look at this

160
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.870
by going into the networking tab.

161
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.870
And if you look at the request that was made

162
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.620
on the extra page, and we look at the response headers,

163
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.840
we can see right here, again, it's very small,

164
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.220
but we can see that there is

165
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.310
Access-Control-Allow-Methods GET,

166
00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.690
Access-Control-Allow-Origin,

167
00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.060
and this is the origin of my first buckets.

168
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.900
So these are the headers

169
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.780
that allow this cross origin request to be made.

170
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.210
Now, I know that what we've seen right now

171
00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.250
may be a bit advanced, of course,

172
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.460
but this CORS settings just come up at the exam

173
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:12.450
at a high level.

174
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:13.283
Did you know what it is?

175
00:07:13.283 --> 00:07:15.060
But I wanted to show you exactly how it worked

176
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.290
so that it becomes very easy

177
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.360
for you to answer this one question.

178
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.040
Okay, that's it for this lecture.

179
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.040
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
