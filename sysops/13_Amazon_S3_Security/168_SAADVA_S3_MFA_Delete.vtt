00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.860
<v Instructor>So now let's talk about a security feature</v>

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.450
called MFA Delete.

3
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.060
MFA stands for multi-factor authentication,

4
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.220
and this is a way to force users

5
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.720
to generate a code on a device.

6
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.700
It could be, for example, a mobile phone

7
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.190
with a Google Authenticator application or whatever,

8
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.870
or another one for example,

9
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.480
or a hardware such as an MFA hardware device.

10
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.890
And this is going to give you a code,

11
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.830
and that code must be inserted into Amazon S3

12
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.990
before doing important operations.

13
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.540
So when is MFA going to be required?

14
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.470
Well, it's going to be required

15
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.320
when you want to permanently delete an object version.

16
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.520
So, this is definitely a protection

17
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.320
against permanent deletions

18
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.540
or if you want to suspend Versioning on the bucket.

19
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.940
So, both these options are quite destructive,

20
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.040
and so MFA will be recovered for this.

21
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.320
But if you want to enable Versioning

22
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.420
or list deleted versions,

23
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.460
then the MFA will not be required

24
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.350
because these are not dangerous operations.

25
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.650
So to use MFA Delete, you must first enable

26
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.940
Versioning on the bucket

27
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.030
because this is relating, of course, to Versioning,

28
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.000
and only the bucket owner, the root account,

29
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.580
can enable or disable the MFA Delete,

30
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.380
as you'll see in the next hands on.

31
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.550
So this is quite complicated

32
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.170
because while using the root account

33
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.760
is not something you should do a lot,

34
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.890
but you will see how do this in the next lecture.

35
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.280
And just remember that MFA Delete is an extra protection

36
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.190
to prevent against the permanent deletion

37
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.260
of specific object versions.

38
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.860
So that's it and I will see you in the next lecture.
