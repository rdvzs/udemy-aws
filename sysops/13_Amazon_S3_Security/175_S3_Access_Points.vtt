00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
<v Instructor>So now let's talk about S3 access points.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.660
So let's take an example

3
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.580
of an S3 bucket that has a lot of data.

4
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.817
We have finance data, we have sales data,

5
00:00:07.817 --> 00:00:09.390
and we have different users

6
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.960
or groups that want to access their data.

7
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.590
We could create a very complicated S3 bucket policy

8
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.330
and make it grow over time.

9
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.340
The more users, the more data you have,

10
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.400
the more unmanageable this may become.

11
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.690
So what is the solution?

12
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.600
Well, we can create what's called S3 access points.

13
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.500
So we can, for example,

14
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.170
create a finance access point that is going

15
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.630
to be connected to the finance data.

16
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.640
How is it connected to the finance data?

17
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.426
Well, we're going to define an access point policy

18
00:00:38.426 --> 00:00:42.600
and this policy looks just like an S3 bucket policy

19
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.930
and is going to grant read write access

20
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.540
to the finance prefix.

21
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.510
Then we can define a sales access point.

22
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.360
And, again, this will be connected to the sales data

23
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.010
thanks to an access point policy,

24
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.350
a different one attached to this access point,

25
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.870
which is going to grant read and write access

26
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.860
to the sales prefix.

27
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.986
As you can see, I now have two policy

28
00:01:03.986 --> 00:01:07.080
and if I want to have an analytics access point,

29
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.350
well, we can create it so that it points to finance

30
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.420
and sales, but in read only access.

31
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.600
So we're going to create our own read only policy

32
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.760
on the analytics access point.

33
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.230
So you can see here we have pushed the security management

34
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.800
from the S3 bucket policy into the access points

35
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.190
and each access point will have its own security.

36
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.310
Therefore, with the proper IAM permissions

37
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.490
then our users can access the finance access points

38
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.210
and connect only to the finance part of our bucket.

39
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.750
The users as well for sales can only access the sales

40
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.600
and the analytics group can access finance

41
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.340
and sales at the same time.

42
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.070
So by using access points, we define different ways

43
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.810
to access our S3 bucket.

44
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.520
And the result of that is that we have

45
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.950
a very simple way to manage security.

46
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.950
We have policies attached to each access point

47
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.780
and also we have a very simple bucket policy on Amazon S3.

48
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.110
Therefore, we can really scale access to our S3 buckets.

49
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.080
So to summarize access points, simplify security managements

50
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.050
for S3 buckets, and each access point will have

51
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.100
its own DNS name.

52
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.470
That's how you connect to the access point.

53
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.170
You can choose it to be connected to the internet

54
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.080
as an origin or a VPC for private traffic.

55
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.600
And then you attach again an access point policy

56
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.940
which is very similar to bucket policy.

57
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.703
And this allows you to manage security at scale.

58
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.420
Regarding the VPC origin of S3 access points,

59
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.240
we can define them to be privately accessible.

60
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.280
So that's, for example, an EC2 instance

61
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.360
in a VPC access says without going through the internet

62
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.780
our S3 bucket through the VPC access point

63
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.550
through a VPC origin.

64
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.790
So to do so, to get access to this VPC origin,

65
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.490
we must create what's called a VPC endpoint

66
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.050
to access the access point.

67
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.530
So it's something in our VPC that will allow us to connect

68
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.510
privately into the access point through our VPC origin.

69
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.989
And then the VPC endpoint has a policy,

70
00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.190
and this policy must allow access

71
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.920
to the target buckets and the access points.

72
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.670
So the VPC endpoint policy will allow our EC2 instance

73
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.090
to connect to both the VPC, the access points

74
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.610
on Amazon S3 and the S3 buckets.

75
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.730
So in this case, we have VPC endpoint for security.

76
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.250
We also have security for the access point policy

77
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.610
and security at the S3 bucket level.

78
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.960
All right. That's it for access points.

79
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.933
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
