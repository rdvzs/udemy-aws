00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.250
<v Instructor>So let's go ahead and create two buckets.</v>

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.000
So I'm gonna call this one my-global-app-stephane

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.163
and then eu-central-1.

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.100
And I'm just going to go all the way down

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.350
and create these buckets.

6
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.780
And then I'm going to create another bucket,

7
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.040
I'll call this one my-global-app-stephane-us-east-1

8
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.840
and I will choose another region being us-east-1.

9
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.450
Okay, so the reason why I am doing this is

10
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.060
that I want to have two buckets in two different regions

11
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.070
that will hold the same data and it will be served

12
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.590
by the same multi-region access point.

13
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.540
So then let's go into Multi-Region Access Points,

14
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.840
and here we can create our multi-region access points.

15
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.043
So I'll call this one MyGlobalApp,

16
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.100
and then we need to add buckets into this access point.

17
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.370
So here I will have app in this

18
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.830
and we have these two buckets that I wanted to add.

19
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.850
So let's add these buckets

20
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.520
and you can see I can add more buckets, okay?

21
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.550
But you only have one bucket per AWS region

22
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.920
as far as it goes right now.

23
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.930
Okay, so then, do we want to block

24
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.640
or to enable public access

25
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.950
for this multi-region access point?

26
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.420
And this is if you wanted to, for example,

27
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.630
to make this public, but right now I'll leave it as default,

28
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.603
and then we'll create this multi-region access point.

29
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.540
And for this, I need to make sure

30
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.310
that the name is lowercase, my-global-app.

31
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.923
All right, now let's create this access point.

32
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.480
So as we can see, it can take less than 30 minutes usually,

33
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.130
but up to 24 hours to create,

34
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.640
so we'll wait for it to be ready and I'll get back to you.

35
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.250
So my multi-region access point is now ready.

36
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.570
I can click on it,

37
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.640
and we have, its ARN, we have its alias,

38
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.710
and we have the buckets, that's underneath.

39
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.710
So if I click on these buckets, I can open them in new tabs,

40
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.110
and before I do so, let's go into Permissions.

41
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.460
So Permissions is how

42
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.890
to access this multi-region access point,

43
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.600
so we need to define an access point policy,

44
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.290
which will allow our application to actually go through it.

45
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.060
And then for Replication and failover,

46
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.620
this is where it gets interesting.

47
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.840
So we have a map of what's happening

48
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.180
for your replication and your failover.

49
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.140
And as you can see right now,

50
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.910
we don't have any replication rules.

51
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.100
And we even have a warning saying that, yeah,

52
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.840
your data replication might be incomplete

53
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.670
because we're missing these rules.

54
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.810
So fairly simple,

55
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.270
we need to just create these replication rules,

56
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.880
and there's a facility to do that from within.

57
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.340
So let's create a replication rule.

58
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.330
And here we have to choose

59
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.120
we want to replicate among all specified buckets,

60
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.610
or from one, two different destinations.

61
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.680
The simplest is obviously the first one,

62
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.960
which was going to give us high availability

63
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.390
and failover capabilities.

64
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.640
So let's choose these buckets,

65
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.500
and to enable the replication,

66
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.480
we must enable bucket versioning.

67
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.510
So this is done directly from this console as well.

68
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.570
And then we enable the rules, okay?

69
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.040
And do we want to limit the scope

70
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.770
or do you want to apply to all objects in the bucket?

71
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.450
We'll say all objects.

72
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.940
And finally, let's go ahead

73
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.160
and create these replication rules.

74
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.240
So now they're created,

75
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.320
and if you had more buckets,

76
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.560
obviously you have replication rules across all the buckets.

77
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.320
And when this is done, you can close this,

78
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.153
go back to your map

79
00:03:08.153 --> 00:03:12.090
and now you can see two-way replication for your buckets.

80
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.200
And you can verify this by also going into your Management,

81
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.840
and here you can find your replication rules.

82
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.673
So that's it,

83
00:03:19.673 --> 00:03:21.120
I'm not gonna show you how to actually use it.

84
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.210
This is more of an application specific type of API calls,

85
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.060
but at least we saw what these are made of.

86
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.440
And just to finish, what you can do

87
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.630
is just delete this multi-region access point.

88
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.640
You're not paying anything for having it,

89
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.930
but in case you are using it,

90
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.450
you will pay extra charges,

91
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.700
based on how many gigabytes go through it.

92
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.870
All right, that's it for this lecture.

93
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.870
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
