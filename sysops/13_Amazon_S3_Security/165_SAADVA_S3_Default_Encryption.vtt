00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.440
<v Instructor>So just a short lecture</v>

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.680
on default encryption versus bucket policies.

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.790
So by default

4
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.790
now all buckets are having a default encryption of SSE-S3.

5
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.060
So it's applied automatically

6
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.160
to new objects toward the new buckets.

7
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.120
But you can change this

8
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.110
to be a different default encryption, for example, SSE-KMS.

9
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.270
Nonetheless, you can also force encryption

10
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.780
by using a bucket policy to refuse any API call

11
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.680
to put an S3 object without the correct encryption headers.

12
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.650
So for example, SSC-KMS or SSE-C.

13
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.340
So this is the kind of bucket policies

14
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.080
you could have in, for example,

15
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.990
this one is saying, hey, if you do a PUT object

16
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.430
but you don't have the encryption header that says AWS KMS,

17
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.930
then deny this request.

18
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.390
Or, hey, if you are uploading this

19
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.680
but there is no customer side algorithm, so no SSE-C,

20
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.970
then deny this object.

21
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.290
So this is just an example,

22
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.660
but at least you see that a bucket policy

23
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.680
can also force a way to have encryption in your buckets.

24
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.290
And by the way, bucket policies are always going

25
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.220
to be evaluated before your default encryption settings.

26
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.290
So that's it, just remember, default encryption

27
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.680
is on by default with SSC-S3 but you can change it

28
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.350
and you can apply a bucket policy preemptively

29
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.110
to force encryption to the one you want.

30
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.040
Alright, that's it.

31
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.073
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
