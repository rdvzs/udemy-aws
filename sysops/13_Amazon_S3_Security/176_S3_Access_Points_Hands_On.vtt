00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.250
<v ->So let's go ahead and create an access point.</v>

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.990
And for this, on the left hand side,

3
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.390
I have the access point direct menu.

4
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.460
And in here I can create an access point.

5
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.067
So I call this one "demo access point."

6
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.690
and then you have to specify a bucket name.

7
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.170
So I can specify the demo-S3-event-Stephane

8
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.480
in my bucket, the region is determined

9
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.060
by my bucket location, so EU-West-1,

10
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.100
and then the network origin for this access point.

11
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.640
So is this a VPC access or is this an internet access?

12
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.680
Now if you specify the VPC access, that means

13
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.330
that you want all the traffic to be coming

14
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.260
from within your VPC.

15
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.970
So you want it to remain private,

16
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.890
in which case, while the S3 console doesn't support

17
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.600
accessing the S3 bucket resource

18
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.810
using the VPC access points, and you need to use the API.

19
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.440
If to specify VPC, you need to obviously specify a VPC ID

20
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.520
but I wanna demo stuff to use.

21
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.550
So I will use the internet, and in the internet

22
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.220
I will be able to access my access point publicly.

23
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.380
Next, do we want to block public access settings

24
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.213
for this access point?

25
00:00:56.213 --> 00:00:59.100
So we have the same setting as your S3 buckets

26
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.090
and then the access point policy, which is written in JSON.,

27
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.460
and will provide access to the object store.

28
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.230
So let's look at some examples

29
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.210
for policies for access points.

30
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.650
So let's say we want to ensure

31
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.740
that this bucket name right here is only accessed

32
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.260
through a access powering policy

33
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.720
and it will only give access to a subfolder.

34
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.750
So for this, I can go into the policies example.

35
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.860
And I will scroll down.

36
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.160
So I will click on access point policies examples,

37
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.510
and then I will show you the first step.

38
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.900
So the first step is to create an access point policy grant.

39
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.410
And so I'm going to copy this and paste it.

40
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.730
And if you look at the statements,

41
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.280
so we allow a specific user, for example,

42
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.160
I can take my account ID in here,

43
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.070
and say the user Stephane is only going to

44
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.760
be able to do get object and put object on,

45
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.440
and then I need to specify the proper region.

46
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.780
So it's EU-West-1.

47
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.060
The account ID again is here.

48
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.410
Access point, okay.

49
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.510
And here is the name of the access point I have.

50
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.610
So let's just copy this name right here

51
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.760
and call it my access point, access point name.

52
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.060
and then object, Stephane, star.

53
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.400
So this is going to only allow me to write

54
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.470
to the directory Stephane star,

55
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.390
which is I think pretty cool.

56
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.300
And so this is the access point policy.

57
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.770
So now it's been applied

58
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.100
and I can access this access point right here.

59
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.030
And as you can see,

60
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.120
it took me directly into the demo-S3-Stephane bucket

61
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.270
and it created an excess point as well in here.

62
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.760
So my access point is now linked to my buckets.

63
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.490
And what I can do is that I can go now

64
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.140
to my bucket's permissions and change the bucket policy.

65
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.780
Why? Well, because we've created an access point in here,

66
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.060
and that means that if we access our S3 buckets

67
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.893
through this access point

68
00:02:42.893 --> 00:02:45.540
and my Stephane user access it through this access point,

69
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.800
then it's only gonna be allowed

70
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.260
to access a specific sub directory.

71
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
But my user's Stephane could still access my bucket

72
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.840
through the buckets directly.

73
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.730
So what I need to do, is go into permissions

74
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.980
and create a bucket policy that will

75
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.310
be blocking any access other than access points.

76
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.630
And to do so, you click on

77
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.150
delegating access control to access points,

78
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.360
and then you need to paste that bucket policy in.

79
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.530
So let's do it.

80
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.830
So we'll edit this bucket policy and paste it.

81
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.160
And in this example we're saying, okay, allow any, when.

82
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.080
Okay, any action

83
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.520
on the bucket ARN,

84
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.350
so which you get the bucket ARN right here.

85
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.350
So the resources, this one and then this one, slash star.

86
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:28.523
Okay.

87
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.540
As long as the access point accounts is

88
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.390
using the buckets accounts ID.

89
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.270
So here it is, I'm going to paste this in.

90
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.920
So effectively what we're saying is that,

91
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.670
this S3 bucket can only be accessed if you are using

92
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.740
an access points coming from this accounts.

93
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.270
And this is the current accounts.

94
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.400
So this is good because now what we're doing,

95
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.690
is that we're saying, hey,

96
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.080
you can only access this buckets, okay,

97
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.730
through the access points.

98
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.740
And now you can define as many access points as

99
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.120
you want directly in here.

100
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.370
So I've created one, but I could create another one.

101
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.200
And then through the access points, as you can see,

102
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.510
we can view the buckets and so on.

103
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.850
And there's going to be a specific ARN

104
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.110
for this access point.

105
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.520
So that's it for this lecture.

106
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.960
We've seen access points in details.

107
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.910
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
