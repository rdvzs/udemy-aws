00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.610
<v Instructor>So here is a short theory lecture.</v>

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.930
But it is important for you to understand

3
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.000
how the VPC Endpoint Gateways work for Amazon S3.

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.960
So by default, an S3 Bucket lives on the

5
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.930
AWS cloud, okay?

6
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.210
But to access it,

7
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.870
you need to go through the public internet.

8
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.820
So that means that's your instance launch

9
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.020
in a public sublet, for example,

10
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.520
will access through the internet gateway

11
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.640
the public endpoints of your S3 Bucket

12
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.650
and the files go that way.

13
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.150
That means that your S3 Bucket can have a Bucket policy

14
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.590
and you can filter by either AWS-SourceIP

15
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.490
to be a public IP of your institute instance, okay?

16
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.800
Now, if you wanted to have a private access

17
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.633
to you S3 Bucket,

18
00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:41.580
so you don't want the traffic to go through

19
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.760
the public internet,

20
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.530
then you deploy your instances reasonable

21
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.110
in a private subnets, and you would create a

22
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.290
VPC Endpoint Gateway.

23
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.730
So this VPC Endpoint Gateway allows you to establish

24
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.080
a private connection from your instance directly

25
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.270
into the S3 Bucket.

26
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.280
And this allows you to create different bucket policies.

27
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.370
So this one, the bucket policy you can apply,

28
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.530
to force access only through a VPC Endpoint Gateway

29
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.480
is to use a Bucket policy by AWS-SourceVpce.

30
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.740
And you can specify one or a few end points,

31
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.897
or you can specify a bucket policy and specify

32
00:01:12.897 --> 00:01:15.430
AWS-SourceVPC condition to encompass

33
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.430
all possible VPC endpoints within a predefined VPC.

34
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.850
So that's it, just for it to show you

35
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.730
the two different ways.

36
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.570
And obviously the VPC Endpoint Gateway

37
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.930
is going to be preferred for security

38
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.830
and also I think for cost reasons.

39
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.510
So that's it for this lecture, I hope you liked it.

40
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.460
And I will see you in the next lecture.
