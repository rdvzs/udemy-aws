00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.010
<v Instructor>So you also have the possibility</v>

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.460
to define multi-region access points on Amazon S3.

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.230
The idea is that with this access point,

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.490
you have a global endpoint

5
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.630
that will span multiple S3 buckets in multiple regions.

6
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.020
And the idea is that you access it only through one endpoint

7
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.780
and this endpoint will redirect you to the S3 bucket

8
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.150
that makes sense in the region that makes sense.

9
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.160
So it's going to dynamically route requests

10
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.600
to the nearest S3 bucket,

11
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.360
therefore providing you the lowest latency

12
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.100
and to make sure that while the data

13
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.260
in all the S3 buckets are equal,

14
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.240
you have bidirectional replication.

15
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.890
So the data is replicated

16
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.010
from one bucket to the next and vice versa.

17
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.650
This way, all your regions are synchronized

18
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.870
and we'll see as well, we have failover controls,

19
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.870
so it's possible for us to define all buckets are active,

20
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.320
or to have some buckets as a backup, so as a passive,

21
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.800
so that if we failover if there's a region problem,

22
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.830
then we can failover to the passive buckets.

23
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.300
So let's have a look at, for example,

24
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.280
an example with three regions.

25
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.970
We have US-EAST-1, EU-WEST-1, and AP-SOUTHEAST-1,

26
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.710
with the same S3 bucket

27
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.770
that's going to be replicated across all regions.

28
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.830
So automatically, these roles are created

29
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.360
by Amazon S3 for you,

30
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.860
so you just have to say it.

31
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.930
But then all the data within these buckets is

32
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.150
going to be replicated no matter what.

33
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.280
And as you can see, we must have replication rules

34
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.860
across all buckets to one another.

35
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.830
Then we create this S3 multi-region access point.

36
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.420
And then when our application is going to

37
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.580
request an S3 bucket object

38
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.190
then we're going to be routed automatically

39
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.280
to the region with the lowest latency.

40
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.900
And in case this region is down

41
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.950
then we may be redirected into the other regions.

42
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.080
So then we have the fellow rear controls I told you

43
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.520
about for your S3 access point.

44
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.640
So let's take an example of a bucket that's across

45
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.680
that's replicated across two regions.

46
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.770
Okay? And we have a multi-region access point.

47
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.690
Now in the case of an active passive fellow rear control

48
00:01:56.628 --> 00:01:58.350
where you're going to designate one bucket as active

49
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.450
and the other one as passive.

50
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.370
Therefore whenever we request an object.

51
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.320
We're not going to go this time to the lowest latency

52
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.390
we're just going to go to the one that's active.

53
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.997
And of course, if you have multiple active ones

54
00:02:07.997 --> 00:02:10.170
you will have the lowest latency.

55
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.620
And in case you will have a regional traffic discretion

56
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.490
for example, US-East-1 is experiencing a bad outage

57
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.330
then automatically you're going to have a failover initiated

58
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.720
and your request will go to the passive S3 bucket

59
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.450
which no matter what will contain all your data.

60
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.060
And these kind of failover controls are valid

61
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.090
for active/passive type of setups, but also active/active.

62
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.090
This is when you can write to multiple regions at a time.

63
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.230
Alright, that's it for this lecture.

64
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.180
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
