00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.170
<v Instructor>So, now, let's talk about</v>

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.240
Amazon S3 pre-signed URLs.

3
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.360
So, they are URLs you can generate using the S3 console,

4
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.950
the CLI or the SDK, and the URL has an expiration.

5
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.220
So if you use the console, it's up to 12 hours

6
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.400
and if use the CLI, you can go up to 168 hours.

7
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.670
So, the idea is that when you generate a pre-signed URL,

8
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.490
the user that will get that URL will inherit the permissions

9
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.480
of the user that generated that URL for a GET or a PUT.

10
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.680
So what's the use case?

11
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.350
Well, say you have an S3 bucket and it's private,

12
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.690
and you want to give someone outside of AWS

13
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.310
access to one file.

14
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.080
You don't want to make that file public.

15
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.990
You don't want to make that file in any way

16
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.700
that would break your security, right?

17
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.100
So, you as your bucket owner or the user,

18
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.750
you're going to generate a pre-signed URL out of this file,

19
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.180
and the S3 Bucket will give you a URL.

20
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.920
That URL is going to be pre-signed,

21
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.500
meaning that it will carry over your credentials,

22
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.680
in terms of authorization to access that file.

23
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.250
Then you will send this URL to the target user

24
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.650
that you want to give access to the file

25
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.330
for a limited amount of time.

26
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.100
And then that user, sorry,

27
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.010
will be using the URL to access the file

28
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.510
on the S3 Buckets.

29
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.390
And then you will get a file back from the S3 buckets,

30
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.320
and the user has being able to download it, for example.

31
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.870
So, pre-signed URL are a very, very common use case

32
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.440
when it comes to temporary access to one specific file

33
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.660
for download or even for upload.

34
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.690
So, the examples are to only allow logged-in users

35
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.450
to download a premium video of your S3 bucket

36
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.880
or to allow an ever-changing list of users

37
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.640
to download files by generating URLs dynamically,

38
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.700
or to allow, temporarily, a user to upload a file

39
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.040
to a precise location in your S3 bucket,

40
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.710
while maintaining your S3 bucket private.

41
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.210
So that's it for this lecture,

42
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.723
and I will see you in the next lecture for some hands on.
