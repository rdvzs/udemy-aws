00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.280
<v Instructor>So now let's have a look</v>

2
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.660
at tags and resource groups.

3
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.140
So first tags, we know them.

4
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.620
They're key-value pairs that we can have

5
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.810
on many AWS resources.

6
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.100
And they're commonly used in EC2,

7
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.290
but many other sources as well.

8
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.100
And they have a free naming convention.

9
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.960
But common tags are going to be named

10
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.820
Environment, Team, and so on.

11
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.990
So we use tags for doing resource grouping,

12
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.440
as we'll see in this lecture,

13
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.820
but for automation as well,

14
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.330
for security, and cost allocation.

15
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.100
And the general rule of thumb is that it's better

16
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.653
to have too many tags then too few.

17
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.440
So with these tags now what we can do,

18
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.610
is that we can leverage them to create resource groups

19
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.740
and to do so while we make sure

20
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.230
that we can group two resources together,

21
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.890
if they share the same tags.

22
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.320
So they will allow us, for example,

23
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.750
to group applications together,

24
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.680
to group different layers of the same application stack,

25
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.470
or to differentiate between a production environment

26
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.100
versus a development environments.

27
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.010
So in this example, I have three EC2 instances.

28
00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.560
Two of them have the environments dev as their tag, okay?

29
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.250
And one of them has the environment prod as their tag.

30
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.341
So what I can do is I can create a resource group

31
00:01:06.341 --> 00:01:09.050
for the filter environment equals dev.

32
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.980
And this will create a logical group

33
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.130
of my first two instances.

34
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.500
So this is something you can do on a regional level, okay?

35
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.820
It's a regional service.

36
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.290
And it works not just with EC2 instances, of course.

37
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.300
But it works with Amazon EC2, S3,

38
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.120
DynamoDB, Lambda, and so on.

39
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.690
Okay, so let's get going with tagging our resources.

40
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.287
So the first instance, right now, I'm going to manage tags.

41
00:01:30.287 --> 00:01:31.910
I'm going to add a tag.

42
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.115
First of all, the name is MyDevInstance.

43
00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:36.872
And then I'm going to add a tag.

44
00:01:36.872 --> 00:01:40.072
The environment is going to be dev,

45
00:01:40.072 --> 00:01:43.496
and the team is going to be finance.

46
00:01:43.496 --> 00:01:45.420
So I'm going to tag my first instance.

47
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.220
And now the name is showing here as well.

48
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.610
The second instance will also be tagged.

49
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.380
So I will manage the tags,

50
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.793
and the name is going to be MyProdInstance.

51
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.502
Now for the environment,

52
00:01:57.502 --> 00:02:00.340
as you may have guessed is going to be prod.

53
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.340
And then for the team, it's still going to be finance.

54
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.970
And finally, I'm going for the last instance

55
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.530
to tag it as well.

56
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.127
So the name is going to be MyOtherDevInstance.

57
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.100
The tag is going to be environment dev,

58
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.860
and finally for the team, I'll use operations.

59
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:25.890
Okay, we're good to go.

60
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.040
So now we have our three instances and from there,

61
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.260
I'm going to be able to create resource groups.

62
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.770
So back into systems manager,

63
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.310
I'm going to go here,

64
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.380
and I'm going to find the resource groups, okay?

65
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.290
So, and then in the search bar, I'm going to go

66
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.040
to resource groups and find the window

67
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.877
for the resource groups.

68
00:02:44.877 --> 00:02:47.260
I'm going to create a resource group,

69
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.600
and it's going to be tagged based, okay?

70
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.320
And then we need to select the resources

71
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.500
so we can use all resource types

72
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.350
to look across our accounts.

73
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.543
Or we can just look for EC2 instances.

74
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.540
And for example, we want you to have the environments.

75
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.550
Oops, environments.

76
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.530
Here we go.

77
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.790
To be equals to dev.

78
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:06.880
And add this.

79
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.270
If we do this, we can preview the resource group resources.

80
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.790
And we can find that two EC2 instances

81
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.240
are in my resource group.

82
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.240
We have my dev instance and my other dev instance.

83
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.340
It's just perfect.

84
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.673
So we'll call this one dev group.

85
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.640
And create this group.

86
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.800
So similarly, we can here create a new resource group.

87
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.960
And this one is going to be again for our EC2 instance,

88
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.800
and the environment is going to be of type prod.

89
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.990
We can preview the resource groups,

90
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.050
and then there's one resource within it.

91
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.233
And this one I can call ProdGroup.

92
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.273
Great.

93
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.150
And next I can create one last group.

94
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.460
So again, my EC2 instances, and for this time,

95
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.080
the team is going to be finance.

96
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.860
And here, I will call this group my finance group.

97
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.850
And again, we can look at the resources

98
00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.530
and we can find two EC2 instances.

99
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.460
My prod instance and my dev instance

100
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.000
belong to this finance group.

101
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.833
So this is good.

102
00:04:04.833 --> 00:04:06.090
We create a group.

103
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.640
And here we go, we have three resource groups.

104
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.600
Now, the reason why we do these resource groups

105
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.600
is that we wanna be able to operate SSM

106
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.150
directly at the group level.

107
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.080
So we can, for example, patch the operating system

108
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.840
and perform some actions and so on.

109
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.180
So this is why it's a prerequisite.

110
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.120
So once you have done your resource groups,

111
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.070
we're good to go for the next lectures.
