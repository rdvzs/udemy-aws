<v Instructor>Okay, so to clean up this section,</v>

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.840
if we go into Fleet Manager,

3
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.240
as we can see under Fleet Manager,

4
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.690
we have three managed instances.

5
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.200
And so that means that we need to terminate them,

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.510
so to make sure we don't have any running cost,

7
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.460
take your three instances and terminate them

8
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.810
and you should be good to go.

9
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.640
So that's it for this lecture, I hope you liked it,

10
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.590
and I will see you in the next lecture.
