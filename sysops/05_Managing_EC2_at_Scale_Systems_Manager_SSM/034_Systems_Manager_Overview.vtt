00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.730
<v ->So now let's discuss a service</v>

2
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.130
that will come up with the exam,

3
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.630
which is the systems manager service.

4
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.110
So this helps you manage a fleet of EC2 instances

5
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.280
and On-Premises servers at scale.

6
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.560
And this is going to be a suite of tool.

7
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.850
They'll see, there's so many tools on systems manager

8
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.250
that will give you insights about

9
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.970
the state of your infrastructure.

10
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.280
It'll allow you to easily detect problem

11
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.750
and also gives you some patching automation

12
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.860
and enhanced compliance.

13
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.600
This is something that comes up in the exam a lot.

14
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.360
Whenever you need to patch your instances,

15
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.136
usually is going to be done with systems manager,

16
00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:34.350
or any kind of automation you'll be running

17
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.720
also will be using systems manager.

18
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.990
So it both it works for both Lou windows and Linux OS,

19
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.390
and it's going to be fully integrated

20
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.360
with CloudWatch metrics and dashboards.

21
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.440
Also integrated with config and it's a free service.

22
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.310
You're only going to pay for the resources that you use

23
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.620
or creates if it does anything like that.

24
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.530
So there's so many features in system manager

25
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.010
and do not be afraid by what I'm going to say,

26
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.310
but there are resource groups, operations managements,

27
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.780
Explorer, OpsCenter,

28
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.100
CloudWatch Dashboard, PHD,

29
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.550
and incident manager.

30
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.340
You have the shared resources menu with documents in it,

31
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.260
then Change Management for Change Manager,

32
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.530
Automation, Change Calendar,

33
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.870
Maintenance Windows.

34
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.250
There's the application management for application manager,

35
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.560
AppConfig and the Parameter Store.

36
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.760
And finally, Node Management for Fleet Manager,

37
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.290
Compliance, Inventory,

38
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.170
Hybrid Activation, Session Manager,

39
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.750
Run Command, State Manager,

40
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.460
Patch Manager, Distributor.

41
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.857
So you may be super afraid right now and you're saying,

42
00:01:25.857 --> 00:01:28.640
"How the hell will I know all these thing?".

43
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.030
The good news is you don't need to know all these things.

44
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.690
In blue is what I will highlight in this course,

45
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.760
which I think are important features

46
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.660
of systems manager you need

47
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.830
to know going into the exam.

48
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.297
So we'll know them at a high level, okay.

49
00:01:40.297 --> 00:01:42.300
Now to be an expert in all of them.

50
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.930
But systems manager is something

51
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.670
that changes a lot over time.

52
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.940
A lot of features have been added

53
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.500
and are being added to this service over time.

54
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.310
So if this list is not up to date, do not worry.

55
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.910
And also if, for example,

56
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.360
tomorrow fleet manager becomes a service

57
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.820
that you need to know going into the exam.

58
00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.420
I'm not going to change that lecture, okay?

59
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.600
But I'm going to add the fleet managers to the section

60
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.210
and you will learn about it as well.

61
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.440
So now if I go into the SSM service, just secured the menu.

62
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.490
So we are in it and,

63
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.960
as you can see on the left-hand side,

64
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.310
we have all these options.

65
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.500
As you can see right here.

66
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.520
AWS knows how to change the structure of them,

67
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.353
as well over time,

68
00:02:16.353 --> 00:02:18.530
so it's not a given that one will be here

69
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.210
and not move here at some points, okay.

70
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.150
But, do not worry,

71
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.690
I will spend some time going over the most important ones,

72
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.010
and they should make sense to you.

73
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.100
Now, how does SSM work?

74
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.470
So we need to install the SSM agent onto

75
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.730
the systems we want to control

76
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.990
at a high level, okay.

77
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.440
And this is an agent that comes bundled

78
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.404
with Amazon Linux 2 AMI.

79
00:02:36.404 --> 00:02:38.576
This is why we love using the Amazon Linux 2 AMI,

80
00:02:38.576 --> 00:02:41.040
and also some Ubuntu AMI.

81
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.990
If your instance cannot be controlled with SSM,

82
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.960
it's probably an issue with the agents

83
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.680
or the IAM permissions, okay.

84
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.670
And if your AMI does not have the assistant agent on it,

85
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.010
it's as simple as running a few commands

86
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.420
to install that agents.

87
00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.520
So we are going to have EC2 instances

88
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.150
with the SSM Agent running or an On-premise's Server

89
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.470
or VM with a SSM Agent running.

90
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.120
And then automatically after the correct configuration

91
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.910
and making sure that these have enough IAM Permissions

92
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.180
to talk to the systems manager service,

93
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.040
then the instance will be connected,

94
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.700
and then systems manager can operate all these kinds

95
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.640
of features out that I just told you about

96
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.520
on the instances to perform,

97
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.190
for example, some compliance or patching

98
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.680
or some automation, okay.

99
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.270
So, if there's an issue with

100
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.370
an instance not being registered into SSM,

101
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.840
you either like to have to look with

102
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.520
the SSM agents not running or not working correctly,

103
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.190
or making sure that's these two instances have

104
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.200
the right IAM role to perform actions on SSN.

105
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.033
So in the next lecture,

106
00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:40.000
what I'm going to do is that I'm going to go ahead

107
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.640
and set up three easy two instances with the SSM agents

108
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.500
and register them into systems manager.

109
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.400
So I will see you in the next lecture.
