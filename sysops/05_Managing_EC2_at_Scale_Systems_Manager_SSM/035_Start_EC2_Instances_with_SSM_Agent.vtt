00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.818
<v ->Okay, so let's get started with systems manager.</v>

2
00:00:02.818 --> 00:00:05.160
And for this we need to first register

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.930
some instances within.

4
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.510
So on the left hand side, let's go into Fleet Manager.

5
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.850
And as you can see right now I have zero managed nodes

6
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.200
but that will change in a second.

7
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.551
So what we want to do is to go into the EC2 console

8
00:00:16.551 --> 00:00:20.940
and start some instances to be registered in Fleet Manager.

9
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.040
So in my EC2 console, I'm gonna go

10
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.160
under instances and I'm gonna click on Launch Instances.

11
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.040
The

12
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.620
operating system is going to be Amazon Linux two.

13
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.540
And the reason we use Amazon Linux two is

14
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.590
that the SSM agent is already running on it.

15
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.130
So all we need is to then give the proper IAM permissions

16
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.700
to our instance, and then it will be registered in SSM.

17
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.730
So if we look at our instance type, we'll choose T2 Micro

18
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.430
for a key pair, we'll proceed without a key pair.

19
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.760
And for a security group, we'll create a new security group.

20
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.380
But as you can see

21
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.470
we will remove any kind of connectivity to it.

22
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.040
So no SSH, no HTTPS, no HTTP, just to show you

23
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.290
that the instance doesn't need to be accessible.

24
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.840
It's the agent that's actually accessing the service

25
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.050
and not the service that's accessing the instance.

26
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.310
So we create a new security group without any rules in it.

27
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.680
And then under advanced details, most importantly

28
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.590
we need to select an IAM instance profile.

29
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.430
So let's click on create new IAM instance profile,

30
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.233
and then we're going to create a role,

31
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.290
and it's for an EC2 instance.

32
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.490
Next.

33
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.720
And then here we need to find the proper permission policy.

34
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.270
So we'll go into SSM.

35
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.950
And here we have the Amazon SSM Managed Instance score,

36
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.110
which contains enough permissions

37
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.810
for the instance to be managed by SSM.

38
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.700
And that's extremely important.

39
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.000
So we'll have this as a

40
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.670
attached policy of my instance.

41
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.500
And then I will scroll down and

42
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.007
go in here and call this Amazon EC2 Role for SSM.

43
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.580
So now we're good.

44
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.880
We have the Amazon SSM Manage Instance Core.

45
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.203
Let's create this role.

46
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.520
And we're good.

47
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.530
So back into our instance Launch,

48
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.270
we need to find this SSM role so

49
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.373
that we created the Amazon EC2 Role for SSM.

50
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.880
And we are going to launch three instances.

51
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.682
So said three instances just to show you how to launch

52
00:02:30.682 --> 00:02:34.680
and have three instances in SSM in the fleet manager.

53
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.910
So let's launch our instances.

54
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.000
Now they have the proper security group and

55
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.100
they have the proper IAM role.

56
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.100
So let's wait until they are up and running.

57
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.370
So my instances are now running and the SSM agent is

58
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.230
going to automatically boot up on them because

59
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.970
we're using Amazon X two.

60
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.033
And therefore if I go into Fleet Manager

61
00:02:53.033 --> 00:02:56.640
and refresh this page, as you can see, my three nodes

62
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.120
are appearing in the managed notes under fleet Manager.

63
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.730
So they're running, we can look at the platform,

64
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.635
the operating system, the source type,

65
00:03:04.635 --> 00:03:08.610
the agent is online, yes, as well as the agent version.

66
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.510
So that's pretty good.

67
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.900
We have successfully started three EC2 instances,

68
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.480
assigned the proper IAM role and fleet.

69
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.010
There is Return Fleet Manager.

70
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.480
And again, what I wanna show you is

71
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.390
that if we look at the security group of my instances

72
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.760
as you can see, there are no inbound rules

73
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.420
which means that it's actually the instance accessing SSM.

74
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.320
Alright, that's it.

75
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.323
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
