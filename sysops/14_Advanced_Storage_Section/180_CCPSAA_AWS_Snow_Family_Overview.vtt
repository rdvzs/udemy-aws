00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.240
<v Instructor>Okay, so now let's talk about AWS Snowball.</v>

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.150
So it's a highly secure and portable device

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.040
that allows you to collect and process data

4
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.910
at the edge and migrate data in and out of AWS.

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.480
So if you have a migration of say, petabytes of data,

6
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.760
Snowball may be a good use case.

7
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.610
So we have two kind of Snowball edge devices.

8
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.920
One is called the Edge Storage Optimized,

9
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.710
and the other one is called the Edge Compute Optimized.

10
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.140
And the difference lies in their storage.

11
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.240
As you can see, one has 210 terabytes

12
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.310
and the other one has 28 terabytes.

13
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.930
So obviously one is for storage

14
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.030
and the other one is only used for computer.

15
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.513
So let me tell you about data migrations.

16
00:00:38.513 --> 00:00:42.510
So it takes a lot of time to transfer some data

17
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.550
over a specific bandwidth speed.

18
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.190
For example, if you want to transfer a hundred terabytes

19
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.590
over one gigabytes per second connection,

20
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.180
it would take you 12 days.

21
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.090
So when you have a slow connection,

22
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.820
you may have limited connectivity, limited bandwidth,

23
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.910
very high network cost, and you have to share the bandwidth,

24
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.215
for example, with some other applications,

25
00:01:02.215 --> 00:01:04.200
the connection may not be stable.

26
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.750
So whenever you have these kind of challenges,

27
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.000
or if it takes you, for example, over a week

28
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.040
to transfer data over the network,

29
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.610
the recommendation is to use a Snowball device.

30
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.250
So the idea is that if you upload directly to Amazon S3,

31
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.980
it's simple, but it may use all your bandwidth.

32
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.210
And if you use Snowball,

33
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.589
well, you're going to receive a physical Snowball device,

34
00:01:24.589 --> 00:01:27.180
you, yourself in your own infrastructure.

35
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.670
So it's a physical machine,

36
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.100
and then you load it with the data you need,

37
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.280
and then finally you ship it back to AWS.

38
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.280
And then you will be having an export process

39
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.950
within AWS to take your data from the Snowball onto,

40
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.200
for example, an Amazon S3 bucket.

41
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.990
So this is the main use case of a Snowball device.

42
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.810
The other one is a edge computing use case.

43
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.760
So the idea is that you wanna process data

44
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.100
while it's being created on an edge location.

45
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.890
For example, it's a truck on the road or a ship on the sea,

46
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.930
or a mining station on the ground.

47
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.450
And these locations may have no internet access

48
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.360
or limited access to internet or compute power.

49
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.400
So here again, we order one of these

50
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.000
big Snowball edge devices and we do edge computing.

51
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.090
And so that means that we have the Compute Optimized,

52
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.440
this is dedicated for that use case

53
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.600
for the search optimized devices.

54
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.540
And then because they have computing capability,

55
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.700
we can actually run EC2 instances

56
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.850
or Lambda functions directly on these devices.

57
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.640
The idea is that once the data is created

58
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.000
and processed, we can send it back again to AWS,

59
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.400
but by using an edge computing device,

60
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.840
we can pre-process the data

61
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.610
or we can do machine learning at the edge

62
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.770
or directly transcode media at the edge.

63
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.650
And that's the use case for edge computing.

64
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.733
So hopefully that makes sense.

65
00:02:44.733 --> 00:02:48.450
The Snowball service is really just something that is used

66
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.090
for data migrations and edge computing.

67
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.680
Alright, that's it, I hope you liked it

68
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.630
and I will see you in the next lecture.
