00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.350
<v Instructor>So let's have a look at the AWS Snow family.</v>

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.540
So we're going to order a Snow family device,

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.730
or at least go through the process of ordering one

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.593
to see what are the options.

5
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.610
So first we have a job name.

6
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.140
So this is my import job, and then you choose a job title.

7
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.420
So do you want to import into Amazon S3.

8
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.310
It's going to be a very good use case.

9
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.280
So Amazon will ship a Snowball device to you

10
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.620
and then you send it back to AWS.

11
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.610
Or do you want to export,

12
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.340
in which case you export data from Amazon S3

13
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.440
and it gets loaded into the Snowball device

14
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.790
and then you receive it.

15
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.650
Or if you want to just do edge computing,

16
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.230
you do local compute and storage only.

17
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.543
So let's do import from Amazon S3.

18
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.910
And then we have Snow devices, so we can choose two of them.

19
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.240
We can choose this one, the Snowball Edge Storage

20
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.490
optimized with 210 terabytes,

21
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.830
or the compute optimized device.

22
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.560
Obviously over time, some of these devices may change,

23
00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.393
but don't worry.

24
00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:01.800
I just wanna show the idea behind Snow family,

25
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.730
so don't worry.

26
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.325
As you can see,

27
00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:06.960
a lot of devices previously have been discontinued.

28
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.000
So these are the two options I have right now,

29
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.380
but from an exam perspective,

30
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.150
this should be more than enough for you to know.

31
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.880
Alright, so next, you choose the pricing option.

32
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.860
So on-demand per day pricing,

33
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.050
the storage transfer, so S3 data transfer,

34
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.430
and then the buckets

35
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.500
that you want to transfer data back into,

36
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.600
for example, this one.

37
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.140
And then no features and options, and then security.

38
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.003
So how do you encrypt your data?

39
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.030
How do you access service types?

40
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.980
So you need to choose a service role.

41
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.710
And this service role will have access to Amazon S3

42
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.410
to allow to create this ServiceLink role

43
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.420
and make sure that our Snow device

44
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.180
has the right to write to our S3 buckets.

45
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.320
And then the shipping address,

46
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.690
so where you want the snow device to be shipped to,

47
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.400
because you're going to receive it,

48
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.600
and then the shipping speed

49
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.000
is a one-day shipping or two day shipping,

50
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.520
and then notifications to see your job status.

51
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.353
And then when you're done,

52
00:01:57.353 --> 00:01:59.010
you have the job summary, and that's it.

53
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.280
You will receive a Snowball Edge device

54
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.960
and you have to load your data onto it

55
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.000
and then send it back to AWS

56
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.950
thanks to the shipping label that's included.

57
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.783
And that's it.

58
00:02:08.783 --> 00:02:10.530
You've seen how the Snow family works.

59
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.730
Obviously we're not going to order one,

60
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.695
because that would be way too complicated,

61
00:02:13.695 --> 00:02:14.940
but I hope you liked it,

62
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.893
and I will see you in the next lecture.
