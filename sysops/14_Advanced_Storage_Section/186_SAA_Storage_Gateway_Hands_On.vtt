00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.290
<v Instructor>So let's go into Storage Gateway</v>

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.590
and we'll have a look at just how to create a gateway.

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.660
So here we have a gateway name.

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.000
So I'll call this one Demo Gateway,

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.870
and let's look at the options.

6
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.690
So we have the Amazon S3 file gateway,

7
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.220
which is to access files in Amazon S3 directly through NFS

8
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.280
or SMB file protocol and has local caching.

9
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.290
We have FSX, but this is grayed out

10
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.690
because this is going away, so forget about it.

11
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.240
Then, we have tape gateway and volume gateway.

12
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.420
So I just wanna show you the quick options of all of these.

13
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.460
So for Amazon S3 file gateway,

14
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.410
we can host it in several different ways.

15
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.830
We can host it on VMware, on Microsoft Hyper-V,

16
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.680
on Linux KVM, or on Amazon EC2.

17
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.820
And if you launch on Amazon EC2,

18
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.090
that means that your caching and your gateway

19
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.370
is going to be within your accounts of AWS,

20
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.470
which may or may not be desirable.

21
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.960
But if you use any of these, for example, VMware,

22
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.510
Microsoft Hyper-V, or Linux KVM,

23
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.860
that means that you can set up

24
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.590
the storage gateway directly on premises

25
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.820
in your data center.

26
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.340
And so therefore, the Amazon S3 data

27
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.270
is going to live closer to your servers.

28
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.030
So this may be more desirable or less based

29
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.890
on your use case.

30
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.930
For the other options, we have tape gateway.

31
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.150
Again, we have different platform options,

32
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.443
and this is to confirm to have

33
00:01:20.443 --> 00:01:24.937
a tape archive using ISCI-VTL,

34
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.880
and to store these tapes in Amazon S3 Glacier.

35
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.510
And finally, volume gateway to have block storage volume,

36
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.460
but backed by Amazon S3.

37
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.710
So here we can see the two options that we like.

38
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.800
We have cached volume and stored volume.

39
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.370
So cache volume is your primary data is stored in Amazon S3,

40
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.500
and your frequently accessed data is retained locally

41
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.540
in the cache for low-latency access.

42
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.480
And stored volume, where your entire dataset

43
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.780
is stored locally, and then it's synced asynchronously

44
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.070
to Amazon S3.

45
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.502
So you have to choose, and for these,

46
00:01:58.502 --> 00:02:01.020
you have different options, like waffle platforms.

47
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.302
But that's it, all the options

48
00:02:02.302 --> 00:02:03.840
I wanted to show you for Storage Gateway.

49
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.840
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
