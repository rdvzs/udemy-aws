00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.060
<v Instructor>So let's have a quick look at Amazon FSx,</v>

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.390
and Amazon FSx is where to get manage file systems

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.740
on AWS.

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.590
So, we can go ahead and create a file system,

5
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.170
and you have to choose between multiple options,

6
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.580
and the one you need to know for sure

7
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.100
for the exam are going to be these four ones.

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.320
If more are added over time,

9
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.730
unless they appear on the exam,

10
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.440
I will not update this lecture,

11
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.360
just to keep it super simple.

12
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.060
So here we have FSx for Lustre, and that's

13
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.450
to provide a Lustre file system for your workload,

14
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.000
and you can just enter the file system details.

15
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.160
You can get a deployment and storage type,

16
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.230
which has, gives you better overage performance.

17
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.690
You can choose your throughput, and so on,

18
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.130
and then the place within your VPC,

19
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.830
and choose any level of encryption.

20
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.750
So we don't need to know that many details

21
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.120
about each file system, okay?

22
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.070
Just that there's Persistent

23
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.480
and Scratch file systems options for Lustre.

24
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.960
Next, if I go back to Amazon FSx for Windows File Server,

25
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.260
this is the way to get a Windows File Server on AWS,

26
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.960
and it's accessible using the Server Message Block,

27
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.850
SMB protocol.

28
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.470
So if we look quickly at the option,

29
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.580
we can do Multi AZ or Single AZ, which is good for Dev.

30
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.230
The Multi AZ is good as well.

31
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.060
The storage type, SSD or HDD, the full gift capacity depends

32
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.190
on the storage capacity, so if you put,

33
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.830
for example, one 10,000 gigabytes,

34
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.980
then we're going to get some options for gift capacity.

35
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.280
We can deposit into a specific VPC.

36
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.590
We can enable Windows authentication

37
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.810
with Active Directory integration,

38
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.650
either through a host, active host directory on AWS,

39
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.860
or a Self-managed Microsoft Active Directory.

40
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.310
And we get encryption, and then we can get more options,

41
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.200
such as auditing, access, main,

42
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.330
backup and maintenance, and so on.

43
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.030
Now for Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP is

44
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.230
to get the NetApp ONTAP popular file system onto AWS,

45
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.960
and the main feature is that it's compatible

46
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.410
with Linux, Windows, and macOS, okay,

47
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.650
and then, you also get access to a really good performance.

48
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.120
So in that case, we can have a look

49
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.820
at the file system options, where we again,

50
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.890
we have Multi AZ or Single AZ,

51
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.350
we specify a storage type capacity

52
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.940
and whether or not we want storage efficiency,

53
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.370
such as features, such as deduplication,

54
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.460
compression, and compaction, okay?

55
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.224
So this is where we quick create,

56
00:02:22.224 --> 00:02:23.220
and standard create, it gives you more option,

57
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.710
but then again, you just need to know this file system

58
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.300
at the high level.

59
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.930
And finally, Amazon FSx for OpenZFS,

60
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.550
and this is to have a ZFS file system on AWS,

61
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.790
which is compatible with Linux, Windows, and macOS as well,

62
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.610
and again, I would invite you to explore the options.

63
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.670
But at a high level, from an exam perspective,

64
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.780
you need to know the differences

65
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.290
between these four options, okay, and all the details

66
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.650
to choose which one is right was in the previous lecture.

67
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.670
So that's it for this lecture.

68
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.650
I hoped you liked it, and I will see you

69
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.650
in the next lecture.
