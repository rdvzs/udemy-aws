00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.740
<v Instructor>Okay, so just a few notes on FSX for SysOps.</v>

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.970
So there is FSx for Windows in Single-AZ and Multi-AZ.

3
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.620
So in Single-AZ, while you have a Single-AZ file system,

4
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.420
and it will automatically still have data replication,

5
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.900
but just from within that AZ, okay.

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.580
And you have two generations for that option,

7
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.550
you have Single-AZ 1, which is just SSD and Single-AZ 2,

8
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.520
which is SSD and HDD, in terms of how the storage is done.

9
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.930
The other option is you want to have Multi-AZ is

10
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.330
to use the FSx for Windows Multi-AZ option,

11
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.010
in which case, where we have two AZs,

12
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.620
and it will be synchronous replications

13
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.170
between the two file system,

14
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.690
between the primary one and the standby.

15
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.260
So this will automatically replicate data across AZ.

16
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.520
It's synchronous, and then in case you have a problem,

17
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.310
there will be an automatic failover.

18
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.000
So in case one file system fails,

19
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.780
then a failover will happen automatically

20
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.840
to the standby replicate.

21
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.660
So it's always recommended in FSx for Windows

22
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.160
to use Multi-AZ instead of using 2 Single-AZ

23
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.130
and doing your own replication between them, okay.

24
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.800
Because this option exists in the exam,

25
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.710
you should always choose Multi-AZ over Single-AZ

26
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.700
in case you want to have failover.

27
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.630
That's it for this lecture.

28
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.583
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
