00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.550
<v Stephane>So here I am in Amazon S3,</v>

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.820
and I'm going to go ahead and create a bucket.

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.310
Now you will notice here that there's a region selected,

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.830
which is Europe, Stockholm, eu-north-1.

5
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.960
And this is because I have the region selection in here.

6
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.380
So choose the region you want to create your bucket in,

7
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.150
and we'll see that Amazon S3 still has a view

8
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.520
over all your buckets across all regions.

9
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.580
Now there's a bucket type that you may or may not see.

10
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.800
So if you're in some regions where it's available,

11
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.770
you will see general purpose or directory new.

12
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.380
And over time, it will be in more regions.

13
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.870
If you don't see it in your region, this is fine.

14
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.830
The option you should choose

15
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.750
if you see it is general purpose.

16
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.400
And if you don't see this option,

17
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.080
it will be automatically general purpose.

18
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.190
So don't touch anything

19
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.400
and don't feel alarmed if you don't see these options.

20
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.370
Directory buckets are for a specific type of use case

21
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.870
that is not covered at the exam,

22
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.730
so I will not be talking about it.

23
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.710
So if you see the screen, choose general purpose.

24
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.640
If you don't see the screen,

25
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.980
everything is fine, do not worry.

26
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.570
Okay, so you choose a region,

27
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.127
and next you need to choose a bucket name.

28
00:00:59.127 --> 00:01:02.880
And so if you enter a bucket name that is already taken,

29
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.930
for example, tests,

30
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.200
and you try all the way down to create your bucket,

31
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.520
you're going to get an error saying

32
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.320
that the bucket with the same name already exists.

33
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.240
So your bucket name must be unique across all regions

34
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.240
and all accounts ever created in AWS.

35
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.060
This is why I name my buckets

36
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.280
with something very, very personal.

37
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.150
For example, it could be Stephane and then demo, S3,

38
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.220
and I usually add version number, v5,

39
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.620
because I've been creating this video many, many times over

40
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.450
as the interface changes.

41
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.740
So, stephane-demo-s3-v5 should be available,

42
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.670
and they should have no errors.

43
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.170
But if someone already took it,

44
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.300
then I will need to change the name.

45
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.580
Okay, so next for object ownership.

46
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.350
Right now you have ACL disabled.

47
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.430
This is recommended.

48
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.480
This is a security setting.

49
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.480
Don't worry about it. We'll leave it as a default.

50
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.000
Now for blocking public access to this bucket,

51
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.950
again, we'll leave this enabled.

52
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.780
So we'll block all public access,

53
00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.910
and we want to have maximum security in our bucket,

54
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.360
so only us can upload files to it.

55
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.400
Next for bucket versioning.

56
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.610
So we want to disable bucket versioning right now,

57
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.520
and we'll see later on how to enable it.

58
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.080
No tags are needed.

59
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.880
And for default encryption,

60
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.890
I'm going to use server-side encryption

61
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.120
with Amazon S3 managed key.

62
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.220
So all my objects are going to be encrypted,

63
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.720
and I will choose the first option.

64
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.700
We'll talk about encryption later on.

65
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.860
And bucket key, I will enable it.

66
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.680
So we'll leave, as you can see, all the settings as default.

67
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.280
The only thing we have set, really, is the bucket name.

68
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.180
So I'll go ahead and create my bucket.

69
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.290
And now it has been successfully created.

70
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.860
And you will see here in this UI all your buckets.

71
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.000
If you have directory enabled,

72
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.320
you will see also directory buckets,

73
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.610
right now I have none.

74
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.770
But your general purpose buckets are here.

75
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.120
Right now, you should see one bucket

76
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.140
if you just created this course.

77
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.980
For me, I have 33

78
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.470
because I've been using my account quite a lot.

79
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.010
And this will deploy buckets for all AWS regions,

80
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.230
not just the one you're in right now, but all regions.

81
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.990
As you can see, I have Ireland, London.

82
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.590
I scroll down, I get us-east-1, Frankfurt, and so on.

83
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.990
So all your buckets are going to be displayed here,

84
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.910
and you can do a little search.

85
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.890
For example, stephane-demo,

86
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.150
and here is my bucket.

87
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.153
So I'm going to click on it and have a look at it inside.

88
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.130
And now in my bucket,

89
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.020
I would like to start uploading objects

90
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.180
because currently you have zero objects.

91
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.020
So let's click on upload, and then we can add files.

92
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.380
And navigate into your code, go into the S3 folder,

93
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.900
and then you will find a coffee.jpg file.

94
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.940
So choose this coffee.jpg file.

95
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.070
As you can see, it's an image jpg,

96
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.530
it has 100 kilobytes in size.

97
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.160
And then the destination is S3 stephane demo,

98
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.040
which is my bucket.

99
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.433
Okay, so let's upload this file.

100
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.313
We're done.

101
00:03:46.313 --> 00:03:48.660
So I can close this on the right-hand side.

102
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.520
And now back into my S3 bucket.

103
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.630
I can see the coffee.jpg file is under my objects.

104
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.430
So I can do is now click on it

105
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.593
and have more details around that file.

106
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.070
So now that we are in the object page,

107
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.350
we can have a look at a bunch of overviews.

108
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.410
So a bunch of properties where it's been uploaded, the size,

109
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.750
the type, and there's an object URL here.

110
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.340
We'll be playing it in a moment.

111
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.780
So how do we do this?

112
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.970
So now we want to open this object

113
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.950
and see if we can open it.

114
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.720
We can view it because we have uploaded it

115
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.880
onto our Amazon S3 buckets.

116
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.490
Therefore, I'm going to click on open.

117
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.440
And if I do click on open, as you can see,

118
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.240
I can see my coffee.jpg file.

119
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.890
So this is the one I have uploaded,

120
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.360
and it is on the internet.

121
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.830
Awesome, right?

122
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.710
But if I go back to my overview

123
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.540
and click on this object url over here.

124
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.810
So I copy it, I paste it, and I enter it.

125
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.720
As you can see, I get an access denied.

126
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.520
And this access denied

127
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.130
tells me that I cannot access my object

128
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.750
using what's called the public URL.

129
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.020
So you can see here, this public URL is not working,

130
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.700
but this URL is working.

131
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.020
So what's the difference?

132
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.100
Well, this URL right here,

133
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.490
if you have a look at it, the beginning is exactly the same,

134
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.490
but then the rest is a very, very complicated and long URL,

135
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.400
because it's called an S3 pre-signed URL.

136
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.233
Why?

137
00:05:09.233 --> 00:05:12.330
Well, because this URL contains actually a signature

138
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.090
that verifies that I am the one making the request,

139
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.950
and therefore it has my credentials in it.

140
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.360
And so because my credentials are encoded in this URL,

141
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.657
then Amazon S3 says,

142
00:05:22.657 --> 00:05:25.650
"Well, Stephane is allowed to view his own object,

143
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.360
therefore I will display it."

144
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.670
So this public URL does not work,

145
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.610
but this pre-signed URL with my own credentials works,

146
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.790
and of course, this URL is only for me.

147
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.080
So we'll see how to make that object public later on,

148
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.633
so that the public URL will function as well.

149
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.610
So let's go back into our bucket, the stephane-demo-s3.

150
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.640
And I have one object, but I can create a folder.

151
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.850
And this folder name may be called images.

152
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.920
So we scroll down and create this folder.

153
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.190
So now I have the images folder in my bucket.

154
00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.540
I can click on it,

155
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.240
and within it, I can upload again a file.

156
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.960
And this time, I will upload the beach.jpg file into,

157
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.930
as you can see, the destination is my images folder

158
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.820
within my S3 buckets.

159
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.890
So let's upload this.

160
00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:14.820
Close this.

161
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.550
As we can see now, we have the beach.jpg object

162
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.500
within the images folder.

163
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.860
And if I go one level up, we can see the folder here.

164
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.030
So this looks just like,

165
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.130
you know, the cloud storage service you used to know

166
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.800
such as Google Drive or Dropbox,

167
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.790
or whatever you want.

168
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.830
Here, we have something very similar

169
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.280
in terms of the user experience on Amazon S3.

170
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.140
So, of course, I can go to images

171
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.660
and I can delete this folder entirely.

172
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.030
So this will delete everything within the folder.

173
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.170
And to delete things,

174
00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.890
I just type permanently delete into the text inputs,

175
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.530
delete my objects, and I'm good to go.

176
00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:50.610
So that's it for this lecture.

177
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.150
We've seen how we can upload objects into Amazon S3.

178
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.640
We've seen how we can open them in two different ways,

179
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.130
creating folders, deleting folders, and so on.

180
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.360
So I hope you liked it,

181
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.310
and I will see you in the next lecture.
