00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.860
<v Instructor>So, now let's talk about versioning</v>

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.240
in Amazon S3.

3
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.500
Because we've seen how to create a website,

4
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.530
but it would be nice to be able to update it in a safe way.

5
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.080
So, you can version your files in Amazon S3,

6
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.670
and this is a setting you have to enable

7
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.350
at the bucket level.

8
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.960
So, we have my bucket and it's enabled with versioning.

9
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.730
So, whenever a user uploads a file,

10
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.430
it's going to create a version of that file

11
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.230
at the selected key.

12
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.990
And then should we re-upload the same key,

13
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.000
should we overwrite that file,

14
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.400
then instead it's going to create a version two,

15
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.830
and then a version three, and so on.

16
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.830
So, therefore, it is best practice to version your buckets.

17
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.663
Why?

18
00:00:35.663 --> 00:00:36.990
Well, the first thing is that it protects

19
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.760
against unintended deletes.

20
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.310
So, for example, if you delete a file version,

21
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.230
actually you just add a delete marker

22
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.420
and therefore you can restore versions

23
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.940
that were previously there instead.

24
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.700
You can also easily roll back to a previous version.

25
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.760
So, if you want to go back to what happened two days ago,

26
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.220
you can take a file and roll it back.

27
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.900
So, there are some notes you need to be aware of.

28
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.030
First of all, that any file that is not versioned

29
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.180
prior to enabling versioning will have the version null.

30
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.790
And also that if you suspend versioning,

31
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.500
it does not delete the previous version,

32
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.570
so, it's a safe operation.

33
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.890
Okay, so now let's go into the console

34
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.140
and have a look at how we can use versioning.
