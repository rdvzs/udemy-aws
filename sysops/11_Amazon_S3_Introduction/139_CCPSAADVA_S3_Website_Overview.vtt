00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.340
<v Speaker>So now let's talk about how Amazon S3</v>

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.760
can be used to create aesthetic websites.

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.320
So S3 can host static websites

4
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.810
and have them accessible on the internet

5
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.090
and the website URL will be depending

6
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.760
on the AWS region where you create this,

7
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.440
either this or that.

8
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.110
And they look very, very similar as you can tell.

9
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.450
But the only difference is that here, you have a dash

10
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.800
and here, you have a dot.

11
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.930
It doesn't really matter for you to remember this

12
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.910
but just so you know, here it is.

13
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.320
So we have an extra bucket

14
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.920
and it will contain files, maybe HTML files, maybe images

15
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.310
and then we're going to enable this to be compatible

16
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.360
with hosting a website.

17
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.660
So this is what it will look like with the corresponding URL

18
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.660
and then the user will access our S3 buckets.

19
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.130
But this will not work

20
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.940
if we don't have public reads enabled on our S3 buckets.

21
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.200
And this is why in the first place,

22
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.200
in the last lecture we learned about S3 bucket policies.

23
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.870
So if you have a 403 forbidden error

24
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.150
after enabling your S3 bucket for reads,

25
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.100
then that means that your bucket is not public.

26
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.070
Therefore, you must attach an S3 bucket policy

27
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.840
that allows it to be public.

28
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.190
So that's it for this short lecture,

29
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.590
now let's go into the hands on to practice this.
