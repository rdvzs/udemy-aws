00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.460
<v Instructor>Okay, so let's enable our bucket</v>

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.420
to be a website.

3
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.760
But first, I'm going to upload one more file here,

4
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.110
I'm going to upload my beach.jpg file into our buckets.

5
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.900
Okay, this is done, so we have two files into our buckets,

6
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.780
and let's go into Properties, scroll down,

7
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.740
and all the way down

8
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.440
you will find the static website hosting.

9
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.610
So click on Edit,

10
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.280
and here we will enable static website hosting.

11
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.590
We want to host a static website

12
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.110
and we need to specify an index document.

13
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.390
So I will say, index.html

14
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.250
and we will have to upload that file.

15
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.430
This is the default or homepage of the websites.

16
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.490
As you can see here, we also have a little warning sign

17
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.780
saying, hey, by the way

18
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.120
if you want to enable this as a website endpoint

19
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.910
you must make all your content publicly readable.

20
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.550
And we've done this in the previous lecture, so that's good.

21
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.220
Okay, so let's go and save this.

22
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.850
So this is saved, and go back into our objects.

23
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.170
And the one thing that's missing here

24
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.170
is that index, that HTML file.

25
00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.190
So let's go to upload this,

26
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.270
we Add files and then I will click on index.html

27
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.450
and then upload, close it.

28
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.090
It's created, so now back into Properties,

29
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.040
let's scroll all the way down,

30
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.740
and you see now that's under static website hosting,

31
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.600
we have a bucket website endpoint.

32
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.350
So I copy this URL, paste it,

33
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.630
and I get, I love coffee.

34
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.463
Hello world!

35
00:01:22.463 --> 00:01:24.810
And my coffee.jpg file.

36
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.020
So this working, so this is my index at HTML file,

37
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.990
and if I right click on this and open this image in new tab,

38
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.170
we have the public URL of our coffee.jpg.

39
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.370
So this is working,

40
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.370
and by the way if you wanted to change the coffee for beach,

41
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.980
well under beach.jpg we can see as well

42
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.690
this beach image right here.

43
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.970
So that means that everything is working,

44
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.390
our S3 bucket is enabled for static website hosting,

45
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.970
and thanks to the S3 bucket policy being public,

46
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.490
we can see all these files.

47
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.860
So we're good to go, I hope you like this lecture

48
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.813
and I will see you in the next lecture.
