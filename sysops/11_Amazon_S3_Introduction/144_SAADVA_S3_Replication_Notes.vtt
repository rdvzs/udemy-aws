<v Instructor>Hey, so just a few notes</v>

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.810
about Amazon S3 Replications.

3
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.480
So after you enable Replication, as you've seen,

4
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.570
only new objects are going to be replicated.

5
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.390
And if you want to replicate existing objects,

6
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.770
then you need to use the S3 Batch Replication feature.

7
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.440
So this will replicate the existing objects

8
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.750
and the objects that have failed Replication,

9
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.510
and in case you have delete operations,

10
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.580
you can replicate these delete markers

11
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.320
from the source bucket to the target bucket.

12
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.650
It's an optional setting, but if you have a deletion

13
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.110
with the version ID, they are not replicated,

14
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.910
so if it's a permanent deletion,

15
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.000
because you want to avoid malicious deletes happening

16
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.190
from one bucket to another.

17
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.590
Finally, there's no chaining of replications.

18
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.150
So that means that if bucket one

19
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.010
has replication to bucket two,

20
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.470
and then, bucket two has replication to bucket three,

21
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.090
then the objects of bucket one

22
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.110
are not replicated into the bucket three, so that's it.

23
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.013
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
