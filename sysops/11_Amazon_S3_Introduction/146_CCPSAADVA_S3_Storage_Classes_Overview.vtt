00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.130
<v Lecturer>Okay, so let's discuss</v>

2
00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.850
different storage classes we have for Amazon S three.

3
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.840
The first one is Amazon S three Standard-General Purpose.

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.300
Then we have Amazon S three-Infrequent Access.

5
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.120
Then we have Amazon S three One Zone-Infrequent Access.

6
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.480
Then we have Glacier Instant Retrieval,

7
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.120
Glacier Flexible Retrieval, Glacier Deep Archive,

8
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.030
and then finally, the Amazon S three Intelligent Tiering.

9
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.800
So we'll learn about all these classes in depth

10
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.120
in this lecture, but you have to know them for the exam.

11
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.140
Then when you create an object in Amazon S three,

12
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.710
you can choose its class,

13
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.440
you can also modify its storage class manually,

14
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.530
or as we'll see as well,

15
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.410
you can use Amazon S3 Lifecycle configurations

16
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.300
to move objects automatically

17
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.920
between all these storage classes.

18
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.460
So first, before we go into the classes,

19
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.470
let's define the concept of durability and availability.

20
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.400
So durability represents how many times an object

21
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.387
is going to be lost by Amazon S three.

22
00:00:52.387 --> 00:00:55.440
And so Amazon S three has a very high durability.

23
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.330
It's called 11 nines.

24
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.490
So nine nine point and then nine times nine percent.

25
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.280
And that means that on average,

26
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.950
if you store 10 million objects on Amazon S three,

27
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.810
you can expect to lose a single object

28
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.420
once every 10,000 years.

29
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.110
So it's quite durable.

30
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.320
And the durability is the same

31
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.520
for all storage classes in Amazon S three.

32
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.140
Availability represents how readily a service is.

33
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.370
And so this depends on the storage class.

34
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.370
For example, S three Standard has a 99.99% availability.

35
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.510
That means that about 53 minutes a year,

36
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.330
the service is not going to be available.

37
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.380
That means that you'll get some errors

38
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.580
when you deal with the service.

39
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.270
So you need to take that into account

40
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.740
when you develop your applications.

41
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.573
Okay.

42
00:01:40.573 --> 00:01:43.520
So S3 standard has 99.99 availability.

43
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.870
It's going to be used for frequently accessed data.

44
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.947
This is the kind of storage you use by default,

45
00:01:48.947 --> 00:01:51.620
and it has low latency and high throughputs.

46
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.110
It can sustain two concurrent facility failures

47
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.370
on the side of AWS and the use cases for it

48
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.260
is going to be big data analytics,

49
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.640
mobile and gaming application,

50
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.563
as well as content distribution.

51
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.560
Next, we have S three infrequent access.

52
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.880
So this is data that is going to be as the name indicates,

53
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.080
less frequently accessed,

54
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.310
but requires rapid access when needed.

55
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.870
It's going to be lower cost than S three Standard,

56
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.430
but you will have a cost on retrieval.

57
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.180
So the S three Standard-IA is 99.9% availability,

58
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.580
so a bit less available.

59
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.340
And the use case for it is going to be Disaster Recovery

60
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.110
and backups.

61
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.540
And Amazon S three One Zone-Infrequent access, One Zone-IA.

62
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.070
ESC has high durability, okay, within a single AZ only,

63
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.550
and the data is going to be lost

64
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.050
if the AZ is somewhat destroyed.

65
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.800
As well as durability, it's even lower.

66
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.440
So it's 99.5% availability.

67
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.080
And so the use cases of S three One Zone-IA

68
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.870
is to store secondary copy of backups

69
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.963
of maybe on-premises data, or data you can recreate.

70
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.740
Next we have the Glacier Storage Classes.

71
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.850
So Glacier is, as the name it gets very cold,

72
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.870
so it's low cost object storage

73
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.070
meant for archiving and backup.

74
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.610
And the pricing is that you're going to pay for the storage

75
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.890
plus pay for a retrieval cost.

76
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.850
In your three classes of storage within Glacier,

77
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.100
you have the Amazon S three Glacier Instant Retrieval.

78
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.310
And this gives you milliseconds retrieval

79
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.460
which is great for example,

80
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.310
for data that's accessed once a quarter,

81
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.120
and the minimum store duration is 90 days.

82
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.790
So this is backup,

83
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.870
but you need to access it within milliseconds.

84
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.270
Then we have the Glacier Flexible Retrieval.

85
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.960
It used to be called Amazon S three Glacier

86
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.330
but then they renamed things as they added more tier.

87
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.950
So the Amazon Glacier Flexible Retrieval

88
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.720
has three flexibility.

89
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.270
So you have expedited where you get the data back

90
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.230
between one and five minutes.

91
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.850
You have standard to get the data back

92
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.150
between three to five hours, or bulk, which is free,

93
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.930
where you get data back between five to 12 hours.

94
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.230
And the minimum storage duration as well is 90 days.

95
00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.170
So here, instance means you retrieve data instantly

96
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.750
and flexible means that you're willing

97
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.490
to wait up to for example, 12 hours to retrieve your data.

98
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.560
And then we have Glacier Deep Archive

99
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.550
which is meant for long term storage.

100
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.520
So we have two tiers of retrieval as well.

101
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.330
We have Standard of 12 hours and Bulk of 48 hours.

102
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.840
So you may be ready to wait a lot of time

103
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.673
to retrieve data,

104
00:04:18.673 --> 00:04:20.700
but it's going to give you the lowest cost,

105
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.280
and as well, the minimum storage duration is 180 days.

106
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.480
So as you know, that's a lot of storage classes

107
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.260
and there's one last called S three Intelligent- Tiering,

108
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.410
which is going to allow you to move objects

109
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.540
between excess tiers based on usage patterns.

110
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.460
And for this, you're going to incur a small

111
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.560
monthly monitoring fee, and auto tiering fee.

112
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.060
And there are no retrieval charges

113
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.150
in S three Intelligent- Tiering.

114
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.130
So there is the frequent access tier that's automatic

115
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.370
the default tier.

116
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.570
Then we have the Infrequent Access tier

117
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.460
for objects not accessed for example, for 30 days.

118
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.350
Then you have the Archive Instant Access tier,

119
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.860
automatic as well for objects not accessed over 90 days.

120
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.010
And then the Archive Access tier that's optional.

121
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.800
And you can configure it from 90 days to 700 plus days.

122
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.000
And then you have the Deep Archive Access tier

123
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.710
also optional, that you can configure for objects

124
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.110
that haven't been accessed between 180 days

125
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.800
to 700 plus days.

126
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.830
Okay.

127
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.710
So S three Intelligent-Tiering is really

128
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.350
to allow you to just sit back and relax

129
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.630
while S three moves objects for you.

130
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.410
So if you compare all the storage classes

131
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.140
you don't need to remember these numbers,

132
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.420
but it's just for you to make sense of what they are.

133
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.160
So you get durability of 11 nine's everywhere.

134
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.630
Then as availability goes down, the less zones you have,

135
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.030
of course.

136
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.770
It just shows you like for example

137
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.570
the minimum storage duration chart and so on.

138
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.960
So take some time to look at this diagram on your own.

139
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.280
You should understand it,

140
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.850
but you should not remember it for sure.

141
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.290
So if we look at some pricing, for example

142
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.640
in the us-east-one,

143
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.270
so this is the kind of pricing you would have

144
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.930
for all the storage classes.

145
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.300
And again, you're not supposed to remember everything.

146
00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.870
But it's good for you to have a look at it

147
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.700
on your own time, just to make sure you understand.

148
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.510
Because if you understand what the classes name are,

149
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.850
then you should be able to make sense of these classes.

150
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:07.720
Okay?

151
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.830
So that's it for the lecture.

152
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:09.760
I hope you liked it.

153
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.710
And I will see you in the next lecture.
