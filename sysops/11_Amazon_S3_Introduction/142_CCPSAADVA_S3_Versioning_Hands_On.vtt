00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.400
<v ->So now let's play with S3 versioning.</v>

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.250
And so first you need to go into the properties

3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.410
and then we have a bucket versioning setting.

4
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.500
We're going to edit this and we're going to enable it.

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.480
And this is to enable bucket versioning.

6
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.870
And therefore any files we override now

7
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.910
is just going to add versions into our buckets.

8
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.743
So this is good.

9
00:00:18.743 --> 00:00:20.100
Let's go into our objects

10
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.380
and say we want to update our website.

11
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.990
So let's go back, find the website URL.

12
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.130
It is right here.

13
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.540
Okay, so we have "I love coffee"

14
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.530
but let's say we want to write, "I really love coffee"

15
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.830
so therefore let's go back into here, our file.

16
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.670
And I'm going to edit it

17
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.070
and say I really love coffee.

18
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.420
I've saved it.

19
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.400
And now I upload this file again.

20
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.960
So I'm going to add a file and it will be my index.html.

21
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.020
And now we have updated content in that file.

22
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.403
So if I upload it.

23
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.470
It's successful.

24
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.840
So now it's been overwritten.

25
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.960
If I go into my first webpage and refresh this,

26
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.570
I get "I REALLY love coffee."

27
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.210
But what did happen in the back?

28
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.860
Well, if we go here

29
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.950
and we have here this toggle "Show versions"

30
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.070
we're going to show the actual version ID with the files.

31
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.360
And so we can notice a few things.

32
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.610
Number one, the files that we had uploaded before

33
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.130
such as the beach.jpg and the coffee.jpg

34
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.780
have a null version id.

35
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.190
That's because they were uploaded

36
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.650
before we had enabled versioning.

37
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.220
But this file index.html as you can see has two versions.

38
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.770
One has version ID null, which is the file we had uploaded

39
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.630
before enabling versioning.

40
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.770
But the file we uploaded just right now has a version ID.

41
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.050
And therefore, by updating this file

42
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.420
and uploading it into our S3 bucket,

43
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.820
we have created a new version ID.

44
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.710
So this is something you can only see if you

45
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.390
enable this toggle.

46
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.770
So now thanks to versioning

47
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.200
what we can do is we can actually roll-back our page.

48
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.300
So we have, "I REALLY love coffee"

49
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.490
but we wanna go back to "I love coffee."

50
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.380
So how do we do this while we click on

51
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.270
this specific version ID

52
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.030
Okay, so make sure that "Show versions" is enabled

53
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.740
and then we're going to delete.

54
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.430
And here we have to delete a specific version ID

55
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.450
of our object.

56
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.000
And therefore when we delete a specific version ID

57
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.490
of our object, it's called a permanent delete.

58
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.670
So it's a destructive operation, it cannot be undone.

59
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.980
And so if we're sure, we type permanently delete

60
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.070
in this text box and click on delete objects.

61
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.840
And now if you go back, as we can see,

62
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.540
we are back with the previous date of our bucket.

63
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.160
And therefore if I refresh this page,

64
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.680
I just get "I love coffee."

65
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.360
But what if we disable "Show versions"?

66
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.220
So now we just have our objects

67
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.770
and I'm going to take this coffee.jpg file,

68
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.630
and I will delete it itself.

69
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.090
So this time we don't actually delete

70
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.010
the underlying version ID,

71
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.100
we delete by adding a delete marker.

72
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.860
And so it doesn't actually delete the underlying object

73
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.880
as we'll see.

74
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.310
Let's just type delete this time.

75
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.560
It's not permanently delete, it's just delete

76
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.930
and we delete the object.

77
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:55.770
Perfect.

78
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.320
So now if we have a look at it from within our bucket,

79
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.080
it looks like the coffee.jpg file is done.

80
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.590
But if we click on "Show versions"

81
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.880
we see that we have a delete marker on our coffee.jpg file

82
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.320
with this version ID.

83
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.070
And the real, the previous, at least, coffee.jpg file

84
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.600
is still in our buckets

85
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.510
but it's being overwritten at least right now

86
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.140
from a version perspective by a delete marker.

87
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.270
So back into our webpage, if I refresh this page

88
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.850
and I refresh it by forcing a refresh,

89
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.690
by doing a Command + Shift + R to force a refresh

90
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.390
then we see that the image is not available.

91
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.220
So how do we get back this image?

92
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.350
And if I just try to, for example,

93
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.690
open this image in the new tab, it doesn't work.

94
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.420
I get a "404 Not Found."

95
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.150
So instead to get back the previous objects

96
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.850
I can click on this delete marker

97
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.130
and I'm going to delete the delete marker.

98
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.060
So I will permanently delete this delete marker.

99
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.910
And the effect of that is that it will restore

100
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.410
the previous version of my object

101
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.600
which is this one from before.

102
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.780
So back into my webpage, if I refresh it now

103
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.480
we can see that the coffee.jpg file is there.

104
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.430
So you can play around with versioning

105
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.980
you can add as many file version as you want.

106
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.680
You can start deleting them and view what happens.

107
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.330
But I hope you like this lecture

108
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.280
and I will see you in the next lecture.
