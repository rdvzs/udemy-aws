00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.940
<v ->So let's create a new bucket industry</v>

2
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:06.623
and call it "s3-storage-classes-demos-2022."

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.700
Okay. Then I create into any kinda region,

4
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.770
and I will go ahead and just create this bucket.

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.560
So back in my bucket, I can go ahead

6
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.010
and upload a object, and click on add files.

7
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.000
I will choose my coffee.JPEG.

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.860
And let's have a look at the options.

9
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.250
So we can look at the properties

10
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.210
of that object,

11
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.030
and under storage class, I get the wide range

12
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.770
of storage class that are for AWS objects.

13
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.640
So we have S3 standard, okay,

14
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.900
and we get the design four column.

15
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.600
How many AZ's we have,

16
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.450
as well as some other (indistinct)

17
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.970
the minimum storage duration,

18
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.480
minimum billable object size,

19
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.500
and monitoring and auto-tiering fees.

20
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.420
So let's have a look at all of them.

21
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.320
So we have standard, which is the basic ones by default.

22
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.090
Then we get intelligent tiering,

23
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.290
in case we don't know our data patterns,

24
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.640
and therefore we want AWS

25
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.080
to perform the data tiering for us.

26
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.490
Standard-IA, if we want data to be infrequently accessed,

27
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.880
but still with low latency.

28
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.880
One-Zone-IA,

29
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.390
which is that you can recreate this data,

30
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.290
and it's going to be stored in one AZ only.

31
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.530
And therefore you can

32
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.150
run the risk of losing the object,

33
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.420
if the AZ is destroyed.

34
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.260
Then we have three glacier levels.

35
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.400
So we have Glacier Instant Retrieval,

36
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.400
Glacier Flexible Retrieval,

37
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.900
or a Glacier Deep Archive,

38
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.490
and it tells you exactly

39
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.770
what are the conditions in here.

40
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.470
And finally, Reduced Redundancy,

41
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.280
which is a deprecated type of storage tier,

42
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.830
and therefore I did not describe it in the course.

43
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.470
So what if we go with standard IA

44
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.460
for example, and create an object there.

45
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.770
So we're going there,

46
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.563
and then we're going to say upload.

47
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.030
Back in our bucket.

48
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.320
So now this object has the storage class, Standard-IA,

49
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.190
as it is shown here.

50
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.170
But what I can do is

51
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.580
that I can also change the storage class

52
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.800
if I wanted to.

53
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.320
So I can go into properties and scroll down,

54
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.820
and we can actually edit the storage class

55
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.380
to do something different.

56
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.720
So we can move it for example,

57
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.000
to One-Zone-IA,

58
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.330
in which case this object is going

59
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.490
to be stored in one zone only.

60
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.260
So let's save these changes.

61
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.310
And now my object has successfully been edited

62
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.690
and therefore the object class has changed.

63
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.320
So if we scroll down, now we are in One-Zone-IA.

64
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.220
And again, you could edit it,

65
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.750
and go, for example, for Glacier-Instant-Retrieval.

66
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.090
And now it's going to be archived,

67
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.020
or you can go for Intelligent-Tiering,

68
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.740
and it could be automatically set

69
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.120
to the right tier based on our patterns, and so on.

70
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.980
So you can see there's a lot of power using storage classes.

71
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.813
And finally,

72
00:02:40.813 --> 00:02:43.270
I want to show you how we can automate moving these objects

73
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.980
between the different storage classes.

74
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.813
So let's go back

75
00:02:45.813 --> 00:02:48.280
into our buckets, and there under management,

76
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.280
you can create lifecycle rules.

77
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.560
And you can create a rule,

78
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.030
and we'll call this one "DemoRule."

79
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.267
And then you're going to say,

80
00:02:55.267 --> 00:02:57.500
"hey," apply to all objects in the buckets.

81
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.080
Yeah, sure.

82
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.600
And then we can say, okay

83
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.260
move current versions between storage classes.

84
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.910
And you're saying, hey, you go

85
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.270
to Standard-IA after, for example, 30 days.

86
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.410
And then you go to Intelligent-Tiering after 60 days.

87
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.700
And then you would go to Glacier-Flexible-Retrieval

88
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.830
after 180 days,

89
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:20.663
and so on.

90
00:03:20.663 --> 00:03:22.820
So you get some transitions.

91
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.300
And in here you can review

92
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.880
all the transitions you have done.

93
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.890
So it is possible

94
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.670
for you to automate moving objects between tiers.

95
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.230
Okay. So that's it,

96
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.490
we've seen everything we need to know about storage classes.

97
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:35.710
I hope you liked it.

98
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.660
And I will see you in the next lecture.
