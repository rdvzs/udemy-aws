00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.420
<v Instructor>So let's go ahead and make a bucket policy</v>

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.920
so that we can access this coffee file from the public URL.

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.010
So to do so, let's go under the Permission tabs.

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.540
And the first thing we have to do is

5
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.480
to allow public access from the bucket setting,

6
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.760
because right now everything is blocked.

7
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.790
So we edit this and we're going to untick this,

8
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.940
and, therefore, we will allow public access.

9
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.770
But again, this is something you would disable

10
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.990
only, and only if, you know you want

11
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.480
to set a public bucket policy.

12
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.770
So this is dangerous action.

13
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.790
So we say yes, because, of course, if you set real data

14
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.000
of your company on an S3 bucket and you make this public,

15
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.550
you have data leaks and that can never be good.

16
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.650
So now, under Permissions overview,

17
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.230
the access that objects can be public.

18
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.640
So that's the first step.

19
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.700
Next, we scroll down and we look at Bucket policy.

20
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.250
So currently we have none and we wanna create one

21
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.220
so that we make our entire bucket public.

22
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.170
So the first thing you can do is look

23
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.110
at the policies example, and this is the documentation,

24
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.580
and it will show you a lot

25
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.230
of use cases on the right hand side

26
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.630
that will show you what's the appropriate

27
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.060
and corresponding bucket policy.

28
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.870
But for us, we're going to use the policy generator.

29
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.240
So here's the AWS Policy Generator,

30
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.240
and we're going to create an S3 Bucket Policy.

31
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.400
So let's select the right type.

32
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.370
We'll allow, and then the principal is going to be a star

33
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.650
because we want to allow anyone

34
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.400
on the Amazon S3 service to perform,

35
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.520
and because we will read objects on our bucket,

36
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.650
we want to perform a getObject.

37
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.790
So here it is.

38
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.250
We want to allow getObjects.

39
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.820
And the Amazon Resource Name must be the bucket name

40
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.560
with a slash, and then with a star.

41
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.150
So let's have a look first.

42
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.810
So back into our S3 buckets, we have the bucket arn here,

43
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.220
the Amazon resource name here.

44
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.930
So we copy it, we paste it into the Amazon Resource Name,

45
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.860
and this is not over.

46
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.890
We add a slash and then we add a star.

47
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.940
And the reason why we do this is that this action,

48
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.910
the getObject action right here,

49
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.820
applies to objects within your buckets,

50
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.460
and, therefore, objects within your bucket

51
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.190
are after a slash and there are stars

52
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.020
to represent these objects.

53
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.820
So let's add these statements

54
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.100
and then let's generate this policy.

55
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.790
And this policy is what we copy into here,

56
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.190
and this is a public S3 policy.

57
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.570
So that means that getObjects are allowed from anyone

58
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.390
on any objects of this bucket.

59
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.440
Okay, that's good.

60
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.573
So let's save these changes.

61
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.280
And there is a space here, so let's remove this.

62
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.420
Perfect.

63
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.500
Save these changes.

64
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.550
Now that works.

65
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.160
So we can see that our bucket policy

66
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.750
has properly been applied.

67
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.050
So, now, let's go into our object, coffee.jpg,

68
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.720
and let's find the object URL, right here.

69
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.120
We copy it and we enter it.

70
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.197
And as you can see now, my coffee image is fully visible

71
00:03:00.197 --> 00:03:03.510
and it is public as well as any other objects

72
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.610
in my Amazon S3 buckets.

73
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.540
So that's it for this lecture.

74
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.320
We've seen bucket policies, we've seen the policy generator,

75
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.870
and we've seen that now our image is public.

76
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.070
So I hope you liked it,

77
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.053
and I will see you in the next lecture.
