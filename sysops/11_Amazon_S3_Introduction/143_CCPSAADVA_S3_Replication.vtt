00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.220
<v Instructor>Now let's talk about Amazon S3 Replication,</v>

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.020
and there are two flavors of it.

3
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.170
So CRR is for cross-region replication

4
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.170
and SRR is for same-region replication.

5
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.300
The idea is that we have an S3 Bucket in one region

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.240
and a target S3 Bucket in another region,

7
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.990
and we want to set up asynchronous replication

8
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.000
between these two buckets.

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.030
So, to do so, we first must enable Versioning

10
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.550
in the source and the destination buckets.

11
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.030
And if we do CRR, so cross-region replication,

12
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.560
the two regions must be different.

13
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.160
If we do SRR, the two regions are the same.

14
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.230
Now, it's possible for you to have these buckets

15
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.180
in different AWS accounts

16
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.340
and copying happens asynchronously.

17
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.710
So the replication mechanism happens behind the scenes,

18
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.910
in the background.

19
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.230
And to make replication work,

20
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.480
you must give proper IAM permissions

21
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.580
to the S3 service so that it has the permission

22
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.400
to read and write from specified buckets.

23
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.100
So the use cases for replication are manyfold.

24
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.160
The first one is that if you use cross-region replication,

25
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.020
this can be helpful for compliance

26
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.360
or for providing lower latency access to your data

27
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.860
because it's in another region,

28
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.620
or to replicate data across accounts.

29
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.530
For SRR, or same-region replication,

30
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.960
this can be very helpful to aggregate logs

31
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.640
across multiple S3 Buckets

32
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.530
or to perform a live replication

33
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.870
between a production and test accounts,

34
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.150
so, you have your own test environment.

35
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.160
Okay, so that's it about replication.

36
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.810
I will see you in the next lecture for some practice.
