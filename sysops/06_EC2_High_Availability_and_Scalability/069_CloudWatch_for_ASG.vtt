00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.330
<v Tutor>So here are some important CloudWatch metrics</v>

2
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:03.163
for your ASG.

3
00:00:03.163 --> 00:00:05.820
So, you have metrics that are collected every one minute

4
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.030
okay, and there are ASG-level metrics

5
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.760
so it's opt-in, and you have GroupMinisize,

6
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.490
GroupMaxsize, GroupDesiredCapacity,

7
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.580
which represents the value of these parameters over time.

8
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.570
Then you have GroupInServiceInstances, PendingInstances,

9
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.120
StandbyInstances, TerminatingInstances, and TotalInstances

10
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.080
and they represent the number of instances based

11
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.370
on the state of them in your ASG,

12
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.260
and to see these metrics as an opt-in

13
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.840
so you should enable metric collection at the ASG level

14
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.830
to do so.

15
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.160
And then you have EC2-level metrics okay.

16
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.220
And by default it's enabled

17
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.870
so you can start seeing the CPU Utilization,

18
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.950
the network in and out and so on.

19
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.880
You get basic monitoring at five minutes level granularity

20
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.693
or detailed monitoring at one minute granularity.

21
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.810
And so in your ASG,

22
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.140
you can enable group metrics collection

23
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.980
by clicking on this enable button

24
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.270
and they will start populating here so you can see,

25
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.750
no data is available right now

26
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.440
because I haven't done it yet,

27
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.130
but these could be very interesting to look at.

28
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.650
And then for the EC2 side, as we can see,

29
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.270
we get some metrics around the CPU utilization,

30
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.750
the disk read, disk writes if this was an instance store,

31
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.550
which it isn't so this is where they're

32
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.650
not sharing anything,

33
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.230
but network in and out is very interesting,

34
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.270
as well as the status check and so on okay.

35
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.330
So hopefully that's very helpful to you.

36
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.250
I hope you liked this lecture and I will see you

37
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.250
in the next lecture.
