00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.160
<v Instructor>So let's have a look at how we can enable</v>

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.160
SSL certificates on both the ALB and the NLB.

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.180
So if I look at the ALB,

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.760
I just have to add one listener, for example,

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.720
I will add a listener, and the protocol will be HTTPS

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.600
and the ports by default will be 443.

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.995
And then we can say, okay if the clients are using

8
00:00:21.995 --> 00:00:24.030
the port 403 for HTTPS protocol,

9
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.603
then forward to a specific target group.

10
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.440
And then we can also have secure listener settings.

11
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.120
So we can say, we can actually set a SSL security policy

12
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.960
to see how to negotiate the certificates itself,

13
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.690
and this is based on if you need, for example,

14
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.830
previous compatibility with older version of SSL or TLS

15
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.560
and so on, so you can leave this as default

16
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.767
and then you need to say where this SSL

17
00:00:52.767 --> 00:00:54.840
or TLS certificate is located

18
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.530
and so it can be in ACM, Amazon Certificate Manager,

19
00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.580
but I currently don't have any,

20
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.820
so I won't see here one or from IAM,

21
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.790
but this is not recommended as domain method.

22
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.880
Or you can import it by just pasting the private key,

23
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.210
the body and the certificate chain here if need be

24
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.730
and then this will import the certificate itself

25
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.310
into ACM directly.

26
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.970
So it's a similar process for the network cloud balancer.

27
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.240
So if I go in the network balancer right here,

28
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.410
and have a look at the listeners,

29
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.820
I can add a listener of it being TLS,

30
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.810
and then we can forward to a demo target group right here

31
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.280
and then for security policy,

32
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.800
we can set whatever policy we want,

33
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.560
as well as choose where the certificate is from

34
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.940
so from SCM, IAM, or import, and finally we can set

35
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.193
an application layer protocol negotiation,

36
00:01:48.104 --> 00:01:48.937
which I won't go over

37
00:01:48.937 --> 00:01:51.270
but this is a pretty advanced setting for TLS.

38
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.270
So that's it, you've seen how to use SSL

39
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.100
or TLS certificates on your load balancers.

40
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.223
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
