00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.800
<v Instructor>And so let's go to the</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.310
Auto Scaling Service in AWS to you have a look at it.

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.730
So as you can see, there's a dedicated console

4
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.372
for the Auto Scaling itself.

5
00:00:09.372 --> 00:00:13.840
So we can find scalable resources

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.310
by CloudFormation stack or by tags

7
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:17.820
or by Auto Scaling groups.

8
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.462
So as you can see, we can select the DemoASG right now,

9
00:00:20.462 --> 00:00:21.903
and I click on next.

10
00:00:21.903 --> 00:00:25.042
Then we need to specify a demo name,

11
00:00:25.042 --> 00:00:28.160
so a name for this scaling plan, so DemoScalingPlan.

12
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.950
Then what do we want to optimize my ASG for?

13
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.300
So as you can see this is an alternative

14
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.890
to configuring scaling directly from here.

15
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.380
You can do scaling directly from the Auto Scaling UI,

16
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.240
so you can optimize for availability

17
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.280
to be stabilizing at 40%.

18
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.890
You can balance, optimize for cost or custom.

19
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.610
And in custom you can choose your own metric

20
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.440
as well as a target value, okay?

21
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.330
But let's say for example,

22
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.800
we want to optimize for availability.

23
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.980
Do we want on top of it to enable predictive scaling,

24
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:57.813
yes or no?

25
00:00:57.813 --> 00:01:00.150
And dynamic scaling, yes or no, okay?

26
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.170
And then it will specify you the configuration details.

27
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.730
So here we are choosing CPU utilization

28
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.560
and have a target value of 40%.

29
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.850
And when you're done, you click on next,

30
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.380
then you can set up your DemoASG, okay?

31
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.850
And so we want to configure some advanced settings.

32
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.350
For example, we can set up all the settings here

33
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.310
to change their values if we wanted to.

34
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.120
Same for dynamic scaling and same for predictive scaling.

35
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.350
Then I'll click on next.

36
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.370
And then we review and we would create this scaling plan

37
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.860
and we'll be good to go.

38
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.470
So I'm not going to do it because it's going to create

39
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.290
the exact same thing that we had from before.

40
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.950
But as you can see from within the Auto Scaling UI,

41
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.870
you can not only configure Auto Scaling group,

42
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.390
but also if we had easier services

43
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.400
or if we DynamoDB tables and so on,

44
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.540
we could find them here and then set up an Auto Scaling plan

45
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.900
that will be appearing right here in these

46
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.700
Auto Scaling plans for you to have a central place

47
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.040
to manage them, okay?

48
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.710
So that's it for this lecture, I hope you liked it.

49
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.660
And I will see you in the next lecture.
