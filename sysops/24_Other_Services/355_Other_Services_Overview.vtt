<v Instructor>Hey, welcome to the section</v>

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.680
on Other Services.

3
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:03.960
So this is just to tell you

4
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.366
that these are going to be random services

5
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.644
that may appear at the exam, maybe on one question.

6
00:00:07.644 --> 00:00:09.534
Sometimes a little bit of information

7
00:00:09.534 --> 00:00:12.467
you need to know on these services is really, really tricky.

8
00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:13.790
But bottom line,

9
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.884
I'm going to show you what you need to know,

10
00:00:14.884 --> 00:00:18.230
and I think just by learning and listening to this lecture,

11
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.882
when you see the question at the exam,

12
00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:21.065
you will remember the lecture

13
00:00:21.065 --> 00:00:22.390
and you'll be good to go.

14
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.800
So I wish you happy learning,

15
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.500
and I will see you in the section.
