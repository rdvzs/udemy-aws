00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.240
<v Instructor>So now let's talk about AWS Amplify</v>

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.645
and it's a complicated service,

3
00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:06.680
but at its core I want you to think of it

4
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.980
as a web and mobile application development tool.

5
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.172
So this Amplify will basically allow you to integrate a lot

6
00:00:14.172 --> 00:00:17.540
of the stack of AWS into one place

7
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.210
to build your web and mobile applications.

8
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.750
So you're a developer,

9
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.000
and you know you wanna do a lot of things.

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.390
You wanna first create backends.

11
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.320
So you're going to use the Amplify CLI

12
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.140
to create an Amplify Backend.

13
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.920
And this backend is going to internally use a lot

14
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.800
of resources from AWS that we know.

15
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.620
Amazon S3 for data storage,

16
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.500
Amazon Cognito for identity,

17
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.020
AppSync for APIs,

18
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.690
API Gateway for APIs as well,

19
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.440
StageMaker for machine learning,

20
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.330
Lex for text detection,

21
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.250
Lambda for functions data service,

22
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.768
DynamoDB for data and so on.

23
00:00:48.768 --> 00:00:50.760
And so the idea is that thanks to Amplify,

24
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.820
we have one place to configure authentication, storage,

25
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.431
API will be REST API or GraphQL API,

26
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.994
CI/CD, PubSub, Analytics,

27
00:00:58.994 --> 00:01:02.280
AI/ML predictions, monitoring, and so on.

28
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.370
Then you connect your code.

29
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.910
It could be from anywhere from GitHub,

30
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.800
from CodeCommit on AWS or Bitbucket, GitLab,

31
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.830
or you can upload your code directly.

32
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:10.663
And so you would go ahead

33
00:01:10.663 --> 00:01:12.890
you integrate all these backend services directly

34
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.080
from within Amplify.

35
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.950
Then you add the Amplify Frontend Libraries

36
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.180
to connect to your Amplify Backend.

37
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.120
And so you have Frontend Libraries for web applications,

38
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.010
mobile applications, as well as many, many frameworks.

39
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.400
And finally, when you're ready,

40
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.046
you're going to deploy using the Amplify Console

41
00:01:29.046 --> 00:01:32.220
to Amplify itself and Amazon CloudFront

42
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.052
for your web or mobile application to be available.

43
00:01:35.052 --> 00:01:37.070
Now they may seem like a lot

44
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.525
but I want you to think as Amplify

45
00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:42.960
as the Elastic Beanstalk for web and mobile applications.

46
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.230
It's just a high level overview, but you need to see

47
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.437
that it allows you to integrate all these things of AWS

48
00:01:48.437 --> 00:01:51.780
into one place, to have a one stop shop for developers

49
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.450
to create web and mobile applications.

50
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.030
All right, that's it for this overview,

51
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.050
I hope you liked it

52
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
