00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.790
<v Instructor>So, now, let's talk about EBS volumes</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.230
and their different volume types.

3
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.300
They come in six different types today,

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.670
and we can group them in several categories.

5
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.070
The first one is gp2, gp3,

6
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.320
which is a general purpose SSD volume

7
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.120
that will balance price and performance

8
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.580
for a wide variety of workloads, and this is something

9
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.590
we've been using so far in this course.

10
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.410
Then we have io1 and io2 Block Express.

11
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.540
They're highest-performance SSD volumes

12
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.670
that will be used for mission-critical low-latency

13
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.040
and high-throughput workloads.

14
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.840
Then we have st1 volumes,

15
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.520
and they're low cost HDD volume

16
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.110
designed for frequently accessed

17
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.940
throughput intensive workloads.

18
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.770
We have sc1 volume, which are going to be

19
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.950
the lowest cost HDD volume, and it will be designed

20
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.470
for less frequently accessed workloads.

21
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.870
Now, how do you define an EBS volume?

22
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.080
Well, you can have several factors, for example, size,

23
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.080
throughput, and IOPS, which means I/O operations per second,

24
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.980
and, obviously, when in doubt,

25
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.470
always consult the documentation.

26
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.320
Now, for your EC2 instances,

27
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.290
only gp2 and gp3 and io1 and io2

28
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.970
can be used as boot volumes.

29
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.110
That means where the root OS is going to be running.

30
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.850
So, now, let's go do a deeper dive

31
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.060
onto gp2, gp3, io1 io2, and the other ones,

32
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.180
but gp2, the general purpose and the provisioned IOPS

33
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.460
are going to be the most important for your exam.

34
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.180
So gp2 is cost effective storage with low-latency,

35
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.950
and you can use it for system boot volumes,

36
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.350
virtual desktops, development and test environments.

37
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.560
The size can vary between one gigabytes to 16 terabytes,

38
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.497
and so we have differences between gp2 and gp3.

39
00:01:34.497 --> 00:01:37.620
Gp3 is the newer generation of volumes.

40
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.500
So gp3 gives you a baseline of 3000 IOPS

41
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.530
and a throughput of 125 megabytes per second,

42
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.070
and then we can increase IOPS up to 16,000

43
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.140
and throughput up to 1,000 megabytes

44
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.920
per second independently, okay, so they're not linked.

45
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.149
For gp2, this is the older version,

46
00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.800
there're small gp2 volumes that can burst up to 3,000 IOPS,

47
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.740
and then the size of the volume and the IOPS are linked.

48
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.320
That means that if you increase the IOPS,

49
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.630
if you increase the number of gigabytes on your volume,

50
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.850
then you're going to get three more IOPS

51
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.520
up to 16,000 IOPS,

52
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.870
and so that means that if you have 5,334 gigabytes,

53
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.570
then you will have 16,000 IOPS, and you'll maxed it out.

54
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.460
So what do you remember from this slide?

55
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.770
You remember that in gp2, gp3,

56
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.650
this is for cost-effective storage latency,

57
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.620
and then gp3, you can independently set the IOPS

58
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.540
and the throughput, whereas for gp2,

59
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.250
they're linked together.

60
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.830
So, now, let's talk about provisioned IOPS volumes.

61
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.190
So they're used for critical business applications

62
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.440
that need to sustain IOPS performance

63
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.420
or applications that need a lot of IOPS,

64
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.640
for example, more than 16,000.

65
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.440
So from an exam perspective,

66
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.020
whenever you see, for example, a database workload

67
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.570
that is very sensitive to storage performance

68
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.900
and consistency, then the provisioned volumes

69
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.733
are going to be great.

70
00:02:55.733 --> 00:02:57.840
So we have the io1 type of volume

71
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.000
between four and 16 terabytes,

72
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.660
and the max IOPS you can provision, so the max PIOPS,

73
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.050
is going to be around 64,000 for natural EC2 instances

74
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.780
and 32,000 for the other kind of instances,

75
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.090
and because we have an io1 type of volume,

76
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.160
we can increase the provisioned IOPS

77
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.590
independently from the storage size.

78
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.310
If we consider the io2 block express type of volume,

79
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.640
you can go up to 64 terabytes of data.

80
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.860
You get sub-millisecond latency,

81
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.000
and you get a lot of max IOPS, such as 256,000

82
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.670
with an IOPS to gigabyte ratio of 1,000 per one.

83
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.930
So this is definitely

84
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.450
a very high performance I/O type of volume,

85
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.330
and on top of this, the provisioned IOPS volumes

86
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.770
that we'll see in the next lectures

87
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.683
support the EBS multi-attach feature.

88
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.870
So, now, let's quickly touch upon st1 and sc1.

89
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.220
So they cannot be a boot volumes.

90
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.530
This is only for the previous types of volumes.

91
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.440
You can get the size up to 16 terabytes,

92
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.020
and we get two kinds of volumes here.

93
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.140
We have the throughput optimized HDD, so st1,

94
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.250
which is great for big data,

95
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.590
data warehousing, and log processing,

96
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.290
which gives you a max throughput of 500 megabytes per second

97
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.720
and a max IOPS of 500,

98
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.650
and then for cold HDD, so sc1, this is for archive data,

99
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.290
so data that is infrequently accessed,

100
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.820
and this is when you would use it

101
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.980
when you need to have the lowest possible cost.

102
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.220
Here, the max throughput is 250 megabytes per second,

103
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.710
and the max IOPS is 250 as well.

104
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.670
Now, you don't have to remember

105
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.500
all these details going into the exam.

106
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.820
You just need to understand the differences

107
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.920
at a high level of all these volumes.

108
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.213
So the general purpose SSD versus the provisioned IOPS SSD,

109
00:04:35.213 --> 00:04:39.291
in case you need a database, versus some st1 and sc1,

110
00:04:39.291 --> 00:04:42.720
in case you need to have high throughput and lowest cost,

111
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.240
and so you can find a summary of all I said

112
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.640
in this link right here, okay,

113
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.260
which is a screenshot I just took you.

114
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.570
So don't need to remember the details again,

115
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.580
but, remember, that if you want to get, also,

116
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.580
over 32,000 IOPS, you need EC2 Nitro with io1 or io2,

117
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.750
and that will be it for this lecture.

118
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.620
So I hope you liked it,

119
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.570
and I will see you in the next lecture.
