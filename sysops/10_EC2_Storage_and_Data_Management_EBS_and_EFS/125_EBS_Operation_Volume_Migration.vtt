<v ->So something SysOps need to know how to do</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.600
is to do EBS migration.

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.010
So as I said, EBS volumes,

4
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.230
they're only locked to do a specific AZ.

5
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.550
And so if you wanted to migrate it

6
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.920
to a different AZ or a different region,

7
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.500
you would need to snapshot the volume, which you just did.

8
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.630
Then we need to optionally copy the volume

9
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.150
to different a region, and then we could create a volume

10
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.550
from the snapshot in the AZ of our choice.

11
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.290
Very simple, but it's good to see it once.

12
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.430
So let's practice.

13
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.650
We have a volume to migrate right here,

14
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.570
and we want to make a change,

15
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.890
its availability zone.

16
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.460
So right now it is in the eu-west-1a AZ,

17
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.430
but we want to move it maybe to eu-west-1b.

18
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.250
So the way to do it, first of all, is to take a snapshot.

19
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.590
So we create a snapshot from it,

20
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.680
and I will just go ahead and create the snapshots.

21
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.310
And if I go to the left hand side now to snapshots,

22
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.310
I can see my snapshot is available and completed.

23
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.150
And that snapshot is just belonging to a specific region.

24
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.080
So from this snapshot,

25
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.010
we can do action and then create volume from snapshots.

26
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.570
And here, I have the opportunity

27
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.120
to choose the target availability zone.

28
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.300
So I can choose, for example, eu-west-1b.

29
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.133
So we're good.

30
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.700
We create the volume.

31
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.630
And if I go now into my volumes page right here,

32
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.790
as you can see, this was the volume to migrate,

33
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.520
and this is the new volume from my snapshots.

34
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.230
And if we have a look at it,

35
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.290
the availability zone now is eu-west-1b.

36
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.580
So very simple operation.

37
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.280
Just need to see it once, but now you know how to do it.

38
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.113
Okay, that's it.

39
00:01:27.113 --> 00:01:30.000
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
