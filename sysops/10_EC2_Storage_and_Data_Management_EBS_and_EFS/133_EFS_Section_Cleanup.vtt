<v Trainer>Hey, so to clean up this section,</v>

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.910
if you have any instances,

3
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.500
make sure you can terminate them

4
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.610
because it will release any EBS volumes attached to them.

5
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.800
Okay, so delete your instances.

6
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.329
Then under volumes, you can delete your volumes as well.

7
00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:15.830
So first you need to delete the snapshot.

8
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.270
So take any snapshots

9
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.640
and then delete the snapshots themselves.

10
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.070
Then you can take a look at the volume

11
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.050
and you do action, delete volume.

12
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.210
So you can do them one by one.

13
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.501
So this one, I can delete the volume.

14
00:00:26.501 --> 00:00:28.300
And this one right here,

15
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.440
I need to wait a little bit until it is detached

16
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.730
and then after being detached, you can delete it.

17
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.490
So I need you to probably refresh this page.

18
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.510
Here we go.

19
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.611
And then delete my volume, this is perfect,

20
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:40.220
which actually doesn't exist

21
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.020
because it's been deleted automatically.

22
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.240
And for EFS file systems,

23
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.620
you can just take this one and delete it

24
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.640
by entering the file system ID.

25
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.190
So that's it for this lecture,

26
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.023
I hope you liked it

27
00:00:50.023 --> 00:00:51.670
and I will see you in the next section.
