00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.410
<v Lecturer>So now let's talk about</v>

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.160
the Multi-Attach feature of the EBS volumes.

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.630
So as the name indicates,

4
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.730
the Multi-Attach feature allows you to attach

5
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.170
the same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances

6
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.660
in the same availability zone.

7
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.493
So what does that mean?

8
00:00:16.493 --> 00:00:17.340
That means that, well,

9
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.590
we have multiple EC2 instances,

10
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.360
and we have an io2 volume

11
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.520
with the Multi-Attach feature enabled.

12
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.440
Then this volume can be attached

13
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.620
to multiple EC2 instances at a time,

14
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.740
which is something that is only available

15
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.740
for the io1 and the io2 family of EBS volumes.

16
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.850
Now, each instance will have

17
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.250
full read and write permissions

18
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.680
to the high-performance volume.

19
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.880
And so that means that they can all

20
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.740
write and read at the same time.

21
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.390
So the use case for this is

22
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.120
you have higher application availability

23
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.340
in case of a clustered Linux application,

24
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.200
for example, using Teradata,

25
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.390
or if your application must manage

26
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.370
concurrent rights operation.

27
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.660
So just so you know,

28
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.390
this Multi-Attach feature is only available

29
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.200
from within a specified availability zone, of course.

30
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.900
It doesn't allow you to attach an EBS volume

31
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.420
from one AZ to another AZ.

32
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.850
Another limitation of Multi-Attach is

33
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.080
that it is up to 16 EC2 instances at a time

34
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.630
that can be attaching the same volume.

35
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.820
And this is something you have to know for the exam,

36
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.910
so be careful to that 16 number.

37
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.800
Finally, for it to work,

38
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.030
you must use a file system

39
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.920
that is going to be cluster-aware.

40
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.700
So it's a different file system than XFS or EX4.

41
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.740
And this is just a little bit more details,

42
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.040
but in case you wanted to use this feature, now you know.

43
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.500
Okay, that's it for this lecture, I hope you liked it.

44
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.650
And then we'll see you in the next lecture.
