00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.253
<v Instructor>So let's have a look</v>

2
00:00:01.253 --> 00:00:03.550
at the EBS volumes attached to our instance.

3
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.490
So if you click on instance

4
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.340
and then you go to the storage tab in here,

5
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.320
you find that there is a root device

6
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.040
and there's a block device on it.

7
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.040
As you can see, we got one volume

8
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.120
of eight gigabytes currently attached

9
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.170
into our EC2 instance.

10
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.440
So what I can do is I can click on this volume

11
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.220
and it will take me into the volumes interface of AWS.

12
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.330
And we can see that, yes, indeed,

13
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.580
our volume exists and it's there.

14
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.160
It's in use as shown here

15
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.070
and it's attached to an instance right here.

16
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.270
So we have a different kind of console here

17
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.240
and to access it, you can just go on the left hand side

18
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.870
and click on volumes.

19
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.340
So as we can see, now we have one EBS of eight gigabytes

20
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.960
and what I can do is I can create a second volume.

21
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.750
So let me create a volume

22
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.710
and I will have many options to choose from,

23
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.970
GP2, GP3 and so on

24
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.970
but I will just use GP2 of type of size two gigabytes.

25
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.210
And then for availability zone,

26
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.690
I can choose the same one where my EC2 instance is.

27
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.690
So for this, I'm gonna go into my EC2 instance, in here

28
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.570
and I will find which availability zone it is on.

29
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.893
So I scroll down,

30
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.930
and it is going to be in the networking one.

31
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.140
So I scroll down in the networking

32
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.560
and here, availability zone, it says eu-west-1b.

33
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.770
Therefore, the volume I will create

34
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.170
is going to be in eu-west-1b

35
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.193
because the EBS volumes are bound by specific AZ.

36
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.020
So that's good.

37
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.000
I will have it done and create this volume.

38
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.210
And now my volume is created.

39
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.530
And what I can do is if I can click on it,

40
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.850
this one is currently not attached.

41
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.690
Okay, so it's been creating

42
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.400
so let me refresh this to see if it's created.

43
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.930
Okay, it's available and it's not attached yet.

44
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.610
So therefore, because it's available,

45
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.740
what I can do is action

46
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.580
and then I can attach the volume

47
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.310
and we need to find an instance.

48
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.040
So we have one running right here.

49
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.340
And so we're going to attach this volume to my instance,

50
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.520
click on attach volume and voila,

51
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.890
our instance now has two EBS volumes attached to it.

52
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.950
How do we know?

53
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.270
Well, I can refresh this page,

54
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.270
go to storage on my EC2 console, scroll down.

55
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.780
As you can see now for block devices,

56
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.310
I have two block devices.

57
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.010
I have the one of eight gigabytes

58
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.350
and the one of two gigabytes.

59
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.750
To actually use this new block device,

60
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.820
it's a bit more complicated

61
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.460
and out of scope for this course,

62
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.460
but you can go to format EBS volume attach EC2,

63
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.390
and you should find something like, yes,

64
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.480
make an Amazon EBS volume available to use on Linux

65
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.330
and this gives you instructions on how to do it

66
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.450
but again, this is out of scope for this.

67
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.470
So now if I go into my volumes and I create a volume,

68
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.720
I can create a volume of two gigabytes of GP2

69
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.400
but this time the AZ is going to be eu-west-1a

70
00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.570
and not eu-west-1b.

71
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.200
So it's gonna be a different AZ

72
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.860
than the one of my EC2 instance.

73
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.210
And the reason I do so is to show you

74
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.110
that right now, we have three GP2 volumes.

75
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.600
So let me refresh this.

76
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.560
So the last one is available and it's a different AZ,

77
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.290
so eu-west-1a.

78
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.280
And if I do actions and then attach volume,

79
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.170
as you can see, I cannot attach it to my EC2 instance

80
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.873
because my EC2 instance is in eu-west-1b.

81
00:03:26.745 --> 00:03:29.300
And so therefore, we can see that the EBS volumes

82
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.583
indeed are bound by a specific availability zone.

83
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.930
Lastly, what I can do is that I can take this volume,

84
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.560
do action, delete volume, and it's gone.

85
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.980
And that really shows you the power of the cloud.

86
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.820
I can just request volumes, delete volumes

87
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.170
right on the go in the matters of seconds.

88
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.330
Okay, so we have our two EBS volumes in here

89
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.800
and what I wanna show you now is a cool behavior.

90
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.800
So what happens if I terminate my instance?

91
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.030
Well remember, and I will show you again,

92
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.330
this one root volume of eight gigabytes

93
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.720
has the delete on termination attribute.

94
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.130
So how do we know?

95
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.140
Well, if I go into my storage

96
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.720
and then go to my block devices, into this table right here,

97
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.330
and scroll all the way right,

98
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.410
you see the first one has delete on termination yes

99
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.000
and the second one no.

100
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.130
So why this one is yes?

101
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.200
Well, I don't know if you remember,

102
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.450
but when you go through the process

103
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.950
of launching an instance, okay?

104
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.670
And then you scroll down to the storage,

105
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.290
in here, if you click on advanced,

106
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.170
you can see the fact

107
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.370
that it is your roots of eight gigabytes

108
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.200
and by default, this delete on termination attribute is yes,

109
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.140
which makes sense, but you could set it to no

110
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.950
if you wanted to keep the root

111
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.730
after terminating your instance.

112
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.140
So this explains why we see from before,

113
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.110
the yes in this table.

114
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.450
And so therefore, if I go ahead and terminate my instance

115
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.420
which I will, so it says successfully terminated

116
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.000
so it's going to really remove it from here.

117
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.050
I can go back into my EBS volumes.

118
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.233
I can refresh them.

119
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.230
And what's going to happen is that this one

120
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.490
soon is going to be available

121
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.660
so because it's going to be detached from my EC2 instance

122
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.110
and then it's going to be terminated.

123
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.160
So I'm going to pause until this is done.

124
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.853
And here we go.

125
00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:22.120
So my eight gigabyte volume has now disappeared.

126
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.310
Only my two gigabyte volume is left

127
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.660
and if I go to my EC2 console,

128
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.340
well, it says that my first instance has been terminated.

129
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.040
So that's it for this lecture.

130
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.110
I hope you liked it

131
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.060
and I will see you in the next lecture.
