00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Instructor>Okay, so what are the components</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.630
EFS CloudWatch Metrics we can have?

3
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.250
Well, the first one is PercentIOLimit,

4
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.690
which is giving you an information

5
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.480
about how close the file system is

6
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.870
to reaching its I/O limit for General Purpose.

7
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.710
And the idea is that,

8
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.220
if you are getting a very, very high percentage,

9
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.230
or if you're getting close to 100%,

10
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.040
the recommendation is to move to Max I/O

11
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.070
to increase your I/O capacity of your EFS file system.

12
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.850
So, though if you wanted to enable Max I/O,

13
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.210
if you remember, you would have to perform a migration

14
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.260
because this operation cannot be done in place.

15
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.160
So that means creating a new file system

16
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.290
with a Max I/O already enabled

17
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.320
and then migrating from the previous file system

18
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.390
to the new file system

19
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.980
using a data sync service.

20
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.350
The other one is BurstCreditBalance.

21
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.620
So the idea is that,

22
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.640
when you have a general purpose EFS file system,

23
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.680
you also have burst credits

24
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.490
that you can use to achieve a higher throughput levels.

25
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.998
But then if the throughput is going up to 100%

26
00:00:54.998 --> 00:00:57.170
and then using all the credits,

27
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.520
then you're going to have a credit balance at zero,

28
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.920
and you need to wait a little bit for it to replenish

29
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.150
until you can use them again.

30
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.450
So this is what I'm showing you

31
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.870
in the graphs on the right-hand side.

32
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.348
On the top is the throughput.

33
00:01:08.348 --> 00:01:09.660
So when it's at 100%,

34
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.570
then the credit balance are going to be used.

35
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.090
And on the bottom is the BurstCreditBalance itself

36
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.120
being replenished when the throughput is less than 100%.

37
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.040
Finally, StorageBytes, which is very easy,

38
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.970
which is a file system's size in bytes,

39
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.540
and which is updated every 15 minutes.

40
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.810
And you get a few dimensions,

41
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.170
which is how much is stored in the Standard class

42
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.450
versus how much is stored in the IA class

43
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.383
and Total is the sum of Standard and IA.

44
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.020
So you can access all the monitoring metrics directly

45
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.810
by clicking on your file system

46
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.890
and clicking on Monitoring.

47
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.240
And then in here you have access

48
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.530
to your throughput utilization,

49
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.540
being a warning when you're at above 75%.

50
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.410
The IOPS by type.

51
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.680
The throughput by type.

52
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.640
The percent IO limit. So this is a very important metric

53
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.630
I just told you about.

54
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.463
Client connections,

55
00:01:52.463 --> 00:01:54.630
which is how many clients are currently connected

56
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.150
to your EFS file system.

57
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.890
And how much storage you're using

58
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.330
on your EFS file system. Okay.

59
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.500
And it could be a time series or a single value

60
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.530
if you wanted to get some real-time information in here.

61
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.630
And you could see more metrics in CloudWatch.

62
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.650
So that's it for this lecture.

63
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.483
I hope you liked it.

64
00:02:09.483 --> 00:02:11.410
And I will see you in the next lecture.
