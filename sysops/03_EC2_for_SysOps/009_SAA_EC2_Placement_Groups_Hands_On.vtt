1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.283
<v Instructor>So let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:01.283 --> 00:00:03.270
and practice placement groups.

3
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.950
To this, on the left hand side,

4
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.120
I'm going to scroll down

5
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.280
and find under network and security,

6
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.660
the placement groups option.

7
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.760
And I will go ahead and create a placement group.

8
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.760
So the first one is going to be my-high-performance-group.

9
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.140
And as you can guess, the placement strategy

10
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.880
for this one is going to be cluster,

11
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.050
because we want instances

12
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.910
to be very close to each other

13
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.913
so that they have maximum network capability.

14
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.063
The second thing is going to be my-critical-group.

15
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.890
And for this one,

16
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.780
the placement strategy is going to be spread,

17
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.610
because we want instances

18
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.190
to be distributed as much as possible.

19
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.720
And you can set the spread level to rack,

20
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.710
which is a default,

21
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.390
or host, which is outpost only,

22
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.290
but we don't use outpost.

23
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.000
So for now we'll just use rack,

24
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.983
which is what we should know about.

25
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.890
Okay. So this critical group has been done

26
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.890
And finally, we have my-distributed-group.

27
00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.670
And this one, as you can guess,

28
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.980
is going to be for the partition type.

29
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.390
And here we have the choice

30
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.520
between one, two, seven partitions.

31
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.030
For example, I can set four, and create this group.

32
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.130
So the three groups have been created.

33
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.470
And now, to just launch an instance in a group,

34
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.483
you click on launch instances.

35
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.490
And now, when you scroll down, at the very bottom,

36
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.120
under the advanced details, you can have a setting

37
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.650
for right here, the placement group name,

38
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.780
and you can select between my-critical-group,

39
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.800
my-distributor-group,

40
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.780
or my-high-performance-group

41
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.360
based on your placement group strategy.

42
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.860
So that's it. It's a very short lecture,

43
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.570
but now you know where the options are.

44
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.680
I hope you liked it.

45
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.630
And I will see you in the next lecture.
