00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.560
<v Instructor>Okay, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.020
and start launching instances

3
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.920
so that we can do our tutorial.

4
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.453
So let's name this one MyFirstInstance.

5
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.370
I will choose Amazon Linux,

6
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.890
and then I will scroll down.

7
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.390
I have a t2 micro.

8
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.500
For a key pair I can use one

9
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.333
I already have,

10
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.400
but I can just also create a new key pair.

11
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.190
Call this one DemoKeyPair.

12
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.970
I have to have RSA pem, and I will create it.

13
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.220
This way I can show you the complete steps

14
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.490
to making sure the key pair is properly configured.

15
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.004
Then for network settings, I can edit this

16
00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:35.440
and I will create a new security group.

17
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.630
I will call it AWSSSH, and then I will make sure

18
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.410
to only have ssh on port 22 allowed from anywhere,

19
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.720
so that's good.

20
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.850
Storage looks good.

21
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.253
And then I will go ahead and launch my instance.

22
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.910
Okay, so my instance is now launched

23
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.369
and I'm going to perform the ssh on it.

24
00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:59.610
So I will copy the public IPV4 address.

25
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.940
From there I'm going to go into my downloads directory.

26
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.500
This is where my key pair is.

27
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.830
So I'm going to change the permissions

28
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.590
of my DemoKeyPair.pem,

29
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.140
and then I will run the ssh utility.

30
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.090
So hopefully I'm not teaching you anything right here,

31
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.533
and then ec2-user@, and then the IP of the instance.

32
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.190
And then if everything's good I will say yes.

33
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.940
And then it will directly add a session to my instance.

34
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.150
And I am in my instance.

35
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.983
So that's good.

36
00:01:28.983 --> 00:01:29.816
I could, as I said to you

37
00:01:29.816 --> 00:01:32.810
now I can do any command such as echo "hello world."

38
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.720
And as you can see, it's working.

39
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.860
The other way I can connect

40
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.390
to my instance is using EC2 Instance Connect.

41
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.490
So to do so,

42
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.450
I just click on EC2 Instance Connect.

43
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.580
The username is suggested by me as ec2-user

44
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.170
which is good because we're using Amazon Linux.

45
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.403
Let's click on connect.

46
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.490
And yet again, I am in my instance

47
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.400
and I can issue any kind of commands.

48
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.233
So that's good.

49
00:01:55.233 --> 00:01:56.280
We have created our instance.

50
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.380
We have connected two (indistinct) in two different ways.

51
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.213
So that's it.

52
00:02:00.213 --> 00:02:01.046
I hope you liked it.

53
00:02:01.046 --> 00:02:02.780
And I will see you in the next lecture.
