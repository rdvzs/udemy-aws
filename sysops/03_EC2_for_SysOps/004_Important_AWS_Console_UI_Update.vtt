<v Instructor>Hi, so just before we get started</v>

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.690
on this course, just a note about the UI change in AWS.

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.410
So you may see the console like this, a big, bright white,

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.610
and then some rounded buttons in bright blue.

5
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.830
So this is the new UI of AWS,

6
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.950
and the old UI used to look a little bit more gray,

7
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.780
the blue, a little more pale.

8
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.540
The buttons were square and not round.

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.960
And this is a new UI with more roundness, more modernness.

10
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.920
On a visual level, it may look a little bit different, okay?

11
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.110
But on the usability perspective,

12
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.030
the UI should be exactly the same.

13
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.410
So if you see my videos recorded with this kind of UI,

14
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.110
just rest assured that the new UI

15
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.360
should look exactly the same from a usability perspective,

16
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.520
not just from a visually perspective.

17
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.560
If things change too much

18
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.810
and there is buttons moving places and so on,

19
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.790
please let me know and I will do my best

20
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.680
to update some videos.

21
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.230
But in the meantime, I will leave my videos

22
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.150
because they have so many of them running

23
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.630
on the quote, unquote older UI,

24
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.790
and the new UI is just for you to figure out.

25
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.320
But it's exactly the same,

26
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.590
just new colors and new shapes for buttons, okay?

27
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.520
So thank you so much,

28
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.470
and I will see you in the next lecture.
