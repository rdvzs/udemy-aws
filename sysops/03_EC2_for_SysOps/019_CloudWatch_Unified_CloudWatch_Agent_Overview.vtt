00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.020
<v Instructor>So let's talk about a way for us</v>

2
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.360
to collect metrics and logs

3
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.590
from within our EC2 instances.

4
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.750
And this is the Unified CloudWatch Agent.

5
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.130
So this is for virtual servers,

6
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.270
it could be for your EC2 instances

7
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.930
or your on-premise servers,

8
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.620
and you're going to connect additional system-level metrics,

9
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.180
such as the RAM, processes,

10
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.700
used disk space, et cetera, et cetera.

11
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.330
And you can also send the logs to CloudWatch logs.

12
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.040
Because by default, if you launch an EC2 instance,

13
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.890
there will be no files, no logs,

14
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.550
that will be sent from your EC2 instance

15
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.550
to CloudWatch Logs

16
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.000
without using an agent,

17
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.030
and that agent could be the CloudWatch Unified Agents.

18
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.030
So the idea is that,

19
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.540
if you wanted to get the memory metric

20
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.910
from within your EC2 instances,

21
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.430
the only way you could do it

22
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.680
is using the CloudWatch Unified Agent.

23
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.760
Then, if you wanted to configure your agent,

24
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.850
you can configure it

25
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.690
by using the SSM Parameter Store

26
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.350
and storing the configuration in a central place.

27
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.810
Or you can specify a configuration file, alternatively.

28
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.280
So you have your EC2 instance

29
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.160
with a Unified CloudWatch Agent

30
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.480
and you want to send metrics and logs to CloudWatch.

31
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.610
For this, you would just configure the agents

32
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.380
and make sure you have the right permissions.

33
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.010
This is also true if you wanted to use a server

34
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.070
from within your own corporate data center.

35
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.040
So on-premises, you would still install

36
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.370
the Unified CloudWatch Agent,

37
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.260
you would specify IAM permissions

38
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.050
and then it would be able to push the logs

39
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.950
and push the metrics.

40
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.264
So they're important because you are interacting

41
00:01:22.264 --> 00:01:25.470
with possibly the SSM Parameter Store,

42
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.170
as well as the CloudWatch Logs

43
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.050
and CloudWatch metrics services.

44
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.450
They need to be able to have the correct IAM permissions

45
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.950
attached to your IAM role on your EC2 instance,

46
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.190
or attached to your access keys

47
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.840
that are deployed on your on-premises servers.

48
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.480
Finally, any metrics that is being pushed

49
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.310
by the Unified CloudWatch Agent,

50
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.970
is starting with the prefix CWAgent,

51
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.200
so this is going to be in this namespace.

52
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.380
You can configure and changes this,

53
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.490
but at least this is the default one.

54
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.800
So, something you need to know that comes up in the exam

55
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.940
is that there is a procstat Plugin, sorry,

56
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.370
on the CloudWatch Agent.

57
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.520
And that means that with this procstat Plugin,

58
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.270
you're going to collect metrics

59
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.710
and monitor system utilization

60
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.000
of individual processes

61
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.450
running on your Linux or Windows servers.

62
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.340
For example, you would get some information

63
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.150
around how much time a CPU will be using,

64
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.120
a process will be using the CPU,

65
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.360
or how much memory a process will be using,

66
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.780
or the process that are running

67
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.060
directly on your EC2 instance.

68
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.340
So you can select which processes to monitor by PID file.

69
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.891
So you can get the PID, so the process ID number,

70
00:02:31.891 --> 00:02:35.500
or you can get the name that you have of the process

71
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.350
or the pattern.

72
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.730
If you want it to filter again,

73
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.290
the processes to monitor

74
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.760
and all the metrics related to your statistics

75
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.050
of your processes on your Linux or windows servers,

76
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.250
we'll be starting with a procstat prefix,

77
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.620
so procstat_time, procstat_cpu_usage, and so on.

78
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.140
So again, what we need to remember out of this

79
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.450
is that if you wanted to get some information

80
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.420
around the processes running and their associated metrics,

81
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.301
the only way to do it

82
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:03.620
would be to use the Unified CloudWatch Agents

83
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.870
deployed on your institute's instances

84
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.890
and configured to use that plugin.

85
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:08.810
So, that's it for this lecture,

86
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.750
I hope you liked it,

87
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.700
and I will see you in the next lecture.
