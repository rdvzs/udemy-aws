00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.160
<v Instructor>Hi, and welcome to this lecture</v>

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.150
on EC2 Instances Purchasing Options.

3
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.640
So we've been using so far, on-demand EC2 instances.

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.190
They allow us to run instances on demands,

5
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.230
that means they're good for short workloads,

6
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.370
we get predictable pricing,

7
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.560
and we're going to pay by the second.

8
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.630
But if you have different kind of workloads,

9
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.450
you can optimize your discounts and your pricing

10
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.750
by specifying it to AWS.

11
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.160
For example, you can use reserved instances

12
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.030
and you have one year or three years term,

13
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.890
and they're meant for long workloads.

14
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.370
So if you know you're going to run a database

15
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.550
for a long time, then a reserved instance is great.

16
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.870
And if you want to have a flexible instance type,

17
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.520
so for example, you want to change

18
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.180
the instance type over time,

19
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.030
then convertible reserved instances are for you.

20
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.620
And by the way, don't worry,

21
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.800
I'm going to do a deep dive in all of those over time.

22
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.800
Okay, next we have savings plan

23
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.870
and savings plan are one and three years term,

24
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:54.770
and they're more modern

25
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.790
because instead of committing to a specific instance type,

26
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.000
you commit to a specific amount of usage in dollars,

27
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.520
and there again, for long workloads.

28
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.140
Spot instances instead are meant

29
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.750
for very short workloads,

30
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.180
they're very, very cheap,

31
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.950
but at any time you can lose these instances

32
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.540
and that makes them less reliable.

33
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.350
Dedicated host allows you to book an entire physical server

34
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.100
and control instance placements.

35
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.210
And dedicated instances means that

36
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.600
no other customers will share your hardware.

37
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.780
Finally, capacity reservations allow you to reserve capacity

38
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.413
in a specific AZ for any duration.

39
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.210
Now let's look at EC2 on-demand.

40
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.420
So you're going to pay for what you use.

41
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.870
So that means that if you're using Linux or Windows,

42
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.140
you're going to be getting a billing per second

43
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.180
after the first minute,

44
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.260
or for all the other operating systems,

45
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.240
you're going to get a billing per hour.

46
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.460
It has the highest cost but no upfront payments

47
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.490
and no long-term commitments.

48
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.770
That means it's definitely recommended for a short-term

49
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.510
and uninterrupted workload

50
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.360
where you cannot predict how the application will behave.

51
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.480
Now for reserved instances,

52
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.150
and by the way, the numbers I show you can change over time,

53
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.200
so I will not update this video every time,

54
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.930
but it gives you an idea of what the numbers can be.

55
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.740
So the reserved instances give you a 72% discounts

56
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.290
compared to on-demand.

57
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.220
And you reserve a specific instance attributes.

58
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.820
For example, the instance type, the region,

59
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.070
the tenancy, and the OS.

60
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.290
You specify a reservation period one year or three years,

61
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.120
to get even more discounts,

62
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.940
and whether or not you wanna pay upfront,

63
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.630
partially upfront, or not upfront.

64
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.670
And all upfront of course gives you

65
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.020
the maximum amount of discounts.

66
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.340
In terms of the scope,

67
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.920
do you want the scope to be

68
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.170
into a specific region or a zone?

69
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.210
That means reserve capacity in a specific AZ.

70
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.500
And so you would use reserved instances

71
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.820
for the steady-state usage applications,

72
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.490
think for example, for a database.

73
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.330
And you can buy or sell your reserved instances

74
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.390
in a marketplace if you don't need them anymore.

75
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.890
And there is a specific kind of reserved instances

76
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.050
called the convertible reserved instance,

77
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.710
which is allowing you to change the instance type,

78
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.000
the instance family, the operating system,

79
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.740
the scope and the tenancy.

80
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.730
And because you have more flexibility,

81
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:09.900
well you get a bit less discounts

82
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.150
you get up to 66% discounts.

83
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.820
So that's for reserved instances.

84
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.400
And now you have the EC2 savings plans

85
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.470
which is to allow you to get a discount

86
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.620
based on long-term usage,

87
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.530
which is the same 70% as reserved instances.

88
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.317
But instead, you're going to say,

89
00:03:26.317 --> 00:03:30.997
"I want to spend $10 per hour for the next 1, 2, 3 years."

90
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.290
And any usage beyond the savings plan

91
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.160
is going to be billed at the on-demand price.

92
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.250
So with savings plans,

93
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.080
you're locked to a specific instance family and region.

94
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.047
For example, you say,

95
00:03:42.047 --> 00:03:46.670
"I want to have M5 type of instance family in us-east-1."

96
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.260
But you're flexible across the instance size.

97
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.810
So you can have m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge and so on.

98
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:53.820
The OS, so you can switch

99
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.010
between Linux and Windows and so on.

100
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.590
And the tenancy, you can switch

101
00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.823
between host, dedicated and default.

102
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.020
Now, for spot instances,

103
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.130
they have the most aggressive discounts,

104
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.520
so up to 90% discounts compared to on-demand,

105
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.810
but they are instances you can lose at any point of time

106
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.400
because you define a max price

107
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.650
you're willing to pay for your spot instances.

108
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.490
And if the spot price goes over it,

109
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.490
then you're going to lose it.

110
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.450
So they're the most cost-efficient instances in AWS

111
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.820
and they're going to be very helpful

112
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.360
if you have a workload that is resilient to failure.

113
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.200
So what could they be?

114
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.660
Well, it could be batch jobs, data analysis,

115
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.140
image processing, any kind of distributed workloads,

116
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.180
or workloads that have a flexible start and end time.

117
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.450
They are not suited for critical jobs or databases

118
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.930
and the exam will test you on that.

119
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.180
Next we have dedicated hosts.

120
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.280
So you get an actual physical server

121
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.440
with EC2 instances capacity

122
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.760
fully dedicated to your use case.

123
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.840
And you want to have dedicated hosts

124
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.580
in the use case of, you have compliance requirements

125
00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.630
or you need to use your existing

126
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.300
server-bound software licenses that has billing

127
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.300
based on a per-socket, per-core, per VM software licenses.

128
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.890
This is in these kind of use cases

129
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.780
that you need to access the physical server

130
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.590
and get a dedicated host.

131
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.387
So for dedicated hosts, you get on-demand,

132
00:05:13.387 --> 00:05:15.040
and you're gonna pay per second,

133
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.640
or you can reserve them for one or three years.

134
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.470
They're the most expensive option of AWS

135
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.640
because you actually reserve a physical server.

136
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.110
And so again, a use case is when you have

137
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.330
a software that comes with a licensing model

138
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.440
that is bring your own license.

139
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.660
Or if you have a company that has strong regulatory

140
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.823
or compliance needs.

141
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.340
We also have dedicated instances,

142
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.000
and there are instances that runs on hardware

143
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.030
that's dedicated to you,

144
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.410
which is different from the physical server.

145
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.270
But you may share the hardware with other instances

146
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.720
in the same accounts

147
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.210
and you have no control over instance placements.

148
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.070
So there's a difference between dedicated instances

149
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.060
and hosts, that is here.

150
00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.040
At the exam, honestly, it doesn't trick you

151
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.530
into one or the other,

152
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.150
but remember that dedicated instances

153
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.200
mean that you have your own instance on your own hardware,

154
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.510
whereas dedicated host,

155
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.990
you get access to the physical server itself

156
00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.393
and it gives you visibility into the lower level hardware.

157
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.110
Next, we have capacity reservations for EC2.

158
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.480
So you can reserve on-demand instances

159
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.480
in a specific AZ for any duration.

160
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.190
And then you get access to that capacity

161
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.460
whenever you need it.

162
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.970
You have no time commitment so you can reserve capacity

163
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.110
or cancel your reservation at any time.

164
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.560
And no billing discounts.

165
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.610
The only purpose is to reserve capacity.

166
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.350
So if you want to get billing discounts,

167
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.390
you need to combine it with regional reserved instances

168
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.320
or your savings plan.

169
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.400
And you're charged at the on-demand rates,

170
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.730
whether or not you run instances.

171
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.310
So that means that your reserved capacity,

172
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.070
you're going to be billed for it,

173
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.290
and you know for sure that if you want to launch instances

174
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.730
they're going to be available,

175
00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.180
but if you don't launch them,

176
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.080
you're still going to get charged.

177
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.020
So they're very suitable

178
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.850
for short-term uninterrupted workloads

179
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.500
that need to be in a specific AZ.

180
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.090
So it gets difficult to understand

181
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.740
which purchasing option is right for me,

182
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.090
especially if you are a beginner.

183
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.850
But let me give you a summary.

184
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:18.320
The first one is on-demand.

185
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.530
So we'll take a resort as an analogy.

186
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:22.920
And with on-demand,

187
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.680
you have a resort and you come in whenever you like

188
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.500
and whenever you like, you pay the full price.

189
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.500
For reserved, well, you like to plan ahead

190
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.450
and you know you're going to stay a very long time

191
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.370
in your resort, one, two, three years,

192
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.290
and then you're going to get a good discount

193
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.800
because we know you're going to stay long time.

194
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.077
Savings plan is saying,

195
00:07:41.077 --> 00:07:43.790
"Hey, I know for sure that in my resort

196
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.160
I'm going to spend a specific amount.

197
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.640
So I'm going to spend maybe $300 per month

198
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.810
every month for the next 12 months."

199
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.960
And therefore, you may wanna change the room type over time.

200
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.240
So king, suite, sea view, and so on.

201
00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.237
But the savings plan is saying,

202
00:07:58.237 --> 00:08:00.020
"Hey, you're to commit

203
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.660
to a specific spending in your hotel."

204
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.020
Spot instances are whenever

205
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.250
the hotel runs very last-minute discounts

206
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.350
because they have empty rooms and they wanna attract people.

207
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.840
So they get empty rooms

208
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.470
and people bid on getting this empty room.

209
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.650
And so you get very, very discounts.

210
00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.330
But in this specific resort,

211
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.660
well, you can get kicked out of at any time

212
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.690
if someone is willing to pay more

213
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.800
for your room than what you did.

214
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.650
But I don't wanna stay in such a resort.

215
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:28.657
Dedicated host is saying,

216
00:08:28.657 --> 00:08:32.880
"Hey, I want to book the entire building of the resort."

217
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.810
So you get your own hardware, your own resort.

218
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:37.727
And then capacity reservation is saying,

219
00:08:37.727 --> 00:08:39.220
"I'm going to book a room,

220
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.200
I'm not even sure if I don't stay in,

221
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.070
but I know that if I want to stay in, I will have it."

222
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.620
And you will pay full price

223
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.643
for booking that room nonetheless.

224
00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.930
In terms of price comparison,

225
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.740
I've just put together this table to give you

226
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.830
one example at one point of time.

227
00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.260
So I took an m4.large in us-east-1,

228
00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.420
and the on-demand price is 10 cents,

229
00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.610
but then the spot price is going to be up to,

230
00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:03.480
for example, 61% off in my example.

231
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.600
Then if you want to reserve your instance,

232
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.710
as you can see, you have different pricing.

233
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.610
If you wanted to have for one year, for three years,

234
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:13.200
and pay no upfront or all upfront.

235
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.020
Same for the EC2 savings plan

236
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.930
we see that it is the same as a reserved instance discounts.

237
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.010
We also get reserved convertible instances

238
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:23.180
and we have dedicated host,

239
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.830
which is at the on-demand price.

240
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.670
The dedicated host reservation which is up to 70% off

241
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.370
because you reserve your host.

242
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.800
And capacity reservation again at the on-demand price.

243
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.110
So the exam will ask you to just know

244
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.350
which type of instance is the right one

245
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.500
based on your workloads.

246
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.400
And by now, you should have some good hints,

247
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.170
and don't worry, we will practice this over time.

248
00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.760
All right, that's it for this lecture,

249
00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:46.760
I hope you liked it.

250
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.710
And I will see you in the next lecture.
