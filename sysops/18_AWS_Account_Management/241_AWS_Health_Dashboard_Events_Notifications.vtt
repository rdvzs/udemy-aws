00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
<v Instructor>Now let's talk about event notifications</v>

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.290
for the AWS Health Service.

3
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.270
So we can actually use EventBridge

4
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.060
to react to any kind of events in your account

5
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.830
through AWS Health.

6
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.630
As an example, it is possible for you

7
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.990
to receive email notifications when EC2 instances

8
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.690
in your accounts are scheduled for updates.

9
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.710
For this, we just have

10
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.750
Health Dashboard triggers EventBridge

11
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.580
and then triggers SNS.

12
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.250
So it's possible for you to receive account events

13
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.510
that are for the resources

14
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.760
that are affected within your account

15
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.320
and also public events

16
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.320
to know the regional availability of a service.

17
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.320
So the use cases of these kind of event notifications

18
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.700
for Health Dashboard

19
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.150
is to send notifications to capture event information

20
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.700
to automatically take corrective action.

21
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.900
So from EventBridge, again,

22
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.510
we have all the EventBridge integrations.

23
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.180
So we can have Lambdas, SNS, SQS,

24
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.310
Kinesis Data Streams and so on.

25
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.530
I wanted to give you a few more examples

26
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.760
into what we could do.

27
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.370
For example, we know that there is an event

28
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.390
in the Health Dashboard to find exposed IAM keys.

29
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.630
So the Health Dashboard will trigger EventBridge,

30
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.950
and for that specific event,

31
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.050
we can integrate a Lambda function

32
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.883
and that Lambda function

33
00:01:10.883 --> 00:01:13.830
will automatically delete the access keys,

34
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.440
therefore remediating the issue.

35
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.720
Or for example, we know that some instances

36
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.420
are scheduled for retirement on EC2

37
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.360
and so the only thing we have to do is to restart them.

38
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.520
So from the AWS Health Dashboard,

39
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.800
we're going to trigger an event in EventBridge

40
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.860
for the instance scheduled for retirement.

41
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.210
And then from EventBridge,

42
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.130
we can manipulate that event

43
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.890
and actually restart right away the instance

44
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.560
as an EC2 action from EventBridge.

45
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.980
Therefore, we'll have fixed all these kind of problems.

46
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.270
So that's it for this lecture.

47
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.393
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
