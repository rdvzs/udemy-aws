<v Instructor>Now, let's talk about AWS Compute Optimizer</v>

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.720
which is used to reduce costs and improve performance

3
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.370
by recommending optimal AWS resources for your workloads.

4
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.350
So it's going to do an analysis

5
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.340
of your EC2 instances, your auto scaling groups,

6
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.620
and tell you, for example,

7
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.350
which one are over-provisioned or under provisioned

8
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.610
and then you can build your optimizations

9
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.430
and then you can have a better cost perspective

10
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.980
and also a better performance.

11
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.960
This way it does it is that it will use machine learning

12
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.650
under the hood to analyze your resource configuration

13
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.780
as well as track their CloudWatch metrics

14
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.800
to understand their utilization.

15
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.840
So supported resources by Compute Optimizer

16
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.530
are EC2 instances, auto scaling groups,

17
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.870
EBS volumes, Lambda functions.

18
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.070
And this allows you to lower your costs by up to 25%

19
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.280
without doing much

20
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.560
and the recommendations themselves

21
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.930
can be exported into Amazon S3.

22
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.300
So that's it, I hope you liked it

23
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.250
and I will see you in the next lecture.
