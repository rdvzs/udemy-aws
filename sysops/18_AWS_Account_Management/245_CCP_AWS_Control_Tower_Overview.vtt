00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.360
<v Instructor>Now let's talk about AWS Control Tower.</v>

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.600
So it is for you an easy way to set up and govern

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.190
a secure and compliant, multi account, AWS environment

4
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.150
based on best practices.

5
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.200
So instead of doing everything manually

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.940
creating an organization and so on

7
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.770
and then applying security practices,

8
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.750
we have Control Tower where you can, with a few clicks,

9
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.300
creates a multi account, AWS environment.

10
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.010
The benefits is that you can automate the setup

11
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.660
of your environments in a few clicks.

12
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.780
You can automate ongoing policy management using guardrails.

13
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.010
You can detect the policy violations and remediate them.

14
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.110
You can monitor your compliance

15
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.578
through an interactive dashboard

16
00:00:34.578 --> 00:00:38.340
and Control Tower is running on top of organizations.

17
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.570
That means that it will automatically set up organizations

18
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.450
for you to organize your accounts.

19
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.370
And it will implement STP service control policies

20
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.150
to make sure that the guardrails are operating effectively.

21
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.040
Okay, so I'll go see you in the next lecture

22
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.453
for a demo of Control Tower.
