00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
<v ->So a small service that can come up in the exam</v>

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.501
is a billing service called "Cost Explorer"

3
00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:07.148
which is used to visualize, understand, and manage

4
00:00:07.148 --> 00:00:09.487
your AWS costs and usage over time.

5
00:00:09.487 --> 00:00:11.520
It allows you to create custom reports

6
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.735
that analyze your cost and usage data.

7
00:00:13.735 --> 00:00:17.240
And so with this, you get dashboards and diagrams and so on.

8
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.820
And so, you can analyze your data at a high level,

9
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.550
for example, total cost and usage across all accounts.

10
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.237
But you can also go down to get it monthly, hourly,

11
00:00:25.237 --> 00:00:27.980
or at the resource level granularity.

12
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.027
And then thanks to Cost Explorer,

13
00:00:29.027 --> 00:00:30.760
you can do some cost savings

14
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.494
because it allows you to choose an optimal Savings Plan

15
00:00:33.494 --> 00:00:35.999
to lower the prices on your bill.

16
00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:39.499
You can forecast usage as well up to 12 months in the future

17
00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:41.190
based on previous usage

18
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.640
which can be very helpful for cost planning.

19
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.360
So if we look at Cost Explorer, here's an example,

20
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.230
we get to "Monthly cost" by AWS Service.

21
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.100
And in this example, we can see, for example,

22
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.231
that some instances based on instance type

23
00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:56.120
can be more expensive than others.

24
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.030
And so we can sort optimizing our cost

25
00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.317
asking ourselves the question

26
00:00:59.317 --> 00:01:01.261
"Are these instances correctly used?"

27
00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:02.857
"Are they maximally used?"

28
00:01:02.857 --> 00:01:05.460
"Are they the right size," these kind of things.

29
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.737
Then we can get also "Hourly and Resource Level."

30
00:01:07.737 --> 00:01:10.070
So in this example, we get, again,

31
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.472
some easy to instance resource level information

32
00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:14.900
and we get the cost over time.

33
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.498
So we can see what happens every single hour

34
00:01:17.498 --> 00:01:20.509
to get a better breakdown and understanding of our bill.

35
00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.493
This is also to find, as I said, a savings plan.

36
00:01:23.493 --> 00:01:26.005
So Savings Plan is an alternative to reserve instances.

37
00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:29.003
We have seen this and so thanks to Cost Explorer

38
00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:30.819
we get this little,

39
00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:33.467
a little pop-up that will come up

40
00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:36.245
and it will tell us what kind of savings plan

41
00:01:36.245 --> 00:01:38.737
we can have based on our usage.

42
00:01:38.737 --> 00:01:40.738
And they will give us some recommendation

43
00:01:40.738 --> 00:01:43.505
and give us some estimated monthly spend and so on.

44
00:01:43.505 --> 00:01:45.400
So this is quite handy.

45
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.820
Finally, we can forecast usage.

46
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.492
So based on previous cost that we had in the past

47
00:01:50.492 --> 00:01:54.236
we can get some forecast and some confidence of the forecast

48
00:01:54.236 --> 00:01:56.732
around how much we're expected to pay for our bill

49
00:01:56.732 --> 00:01:58.493
based on our previous usage.

50
00:01:58.493 --> 00:01:59.998
And that could be quite helpful.

51
00:01:59.998 --> 00:02:02.508
So these kinds of use cases can come up in the exam.

52
00:02:02.508 --> 00:02:04.248
And this is probably the only billing service

53
00:02:04.248 --> 00:02:06.488
that AWS will ask you in the exam.

54
00:02:06.488 --> 00:02:07.492
So that's it.

55
00:02:07.492 --> 00:02:09.393
I will see you in the next lecture.
