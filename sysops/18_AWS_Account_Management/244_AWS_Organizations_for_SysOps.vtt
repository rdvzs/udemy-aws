00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.780
<v StÃ©phane>So just a little bit of extra information</v>

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.280
regarding organizations for the SysOps exam.

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.580
The first of all, you can enable

4
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.690
what's called Reserved Instances sharing

5
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.280
in your organization.

6
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.770
That means that all the accounts of your organizations

7
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.900
will have access to all the Reserved Instances.

8
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.730
And so, that means that any account can use

9
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.700
any other's accounts' RI's,

10
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.750
and this is obviously for cost saving.

11
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.680
But, you may want to disable that

12
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.587
for any specific account,

13
00:00:24.587 --> 00:00:26.300
including the payer accounts,

14
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.580
in which case, the Reserved Instances

15
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.200
or even your savings plans

16
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.610
will not be shared across accounts.

17
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.430
Okay, so this is something to know.

18
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.370
It's a setting you have to turn on and off,

19
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.390
but for having the RI or the Savings Plan discounts enabled

20
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.283
between two accounts, they must both have sharing turned on.

21
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.530
The second thing is that using organizations,

22
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.230
you can use a specific condition in your IAM policies called

23
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.570
the aws:PrincipalOrgID

24
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.390
to allow access from any,

25
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.710
IAM principles from all the accounts in your organization.

26
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.080
So, say you have an organization with a management account

27
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.680
and two member accounts with different IAM users.

28
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.230
If you set up an extra bucket

29
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.180
and you're using the bucket policy,

30
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.670
the aws:PrincipalOrgID condition,

31
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.790
then you're giving access automatically to any user

32
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.120
or any roles within your organization to this extra buckets.

33
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.630
So, it's a good way for you to not have to specify

34
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.120
every individual accounts,

35
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.670
but instead reference only the leading organization

36
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.240
of your accounts.

37
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.290
Finally, you can implement tag policies for your accounts.

38
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.130
So, this is a different way to do some policies.

39
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.120
So, we've seen that there are service control policies,

40
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.290
but also tag policies.

41
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.290
And this is your enforce tagging in your accounts.

42
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.140
So, this is your standardize, all the tags

43
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.180
and the goal is to maybe audit tagged resources,

44
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.420
maintain proper resource categorization.

45
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.500
So they find the tag keys in their lab values.

46
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.920
And obviously if you have cost allocation tags enabled,

47
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.160
or if you do attribute-based access controls,

48
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.030
then this can be very, very helpful.

49
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.670
And then regarding the non-compliance of your tags.

50
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.580
So it's possible for you to generate a list

51
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.310
that will show you all the non-compliant resources

52
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.170
and you can use CloudWatch Events as well

53
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.610
to monitor non-compliant tags if you needed to.

54
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.210
So, that's it for organizations.

55
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.200
I hope you liked it.

56
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.150
And I will see you in the next lecture.
