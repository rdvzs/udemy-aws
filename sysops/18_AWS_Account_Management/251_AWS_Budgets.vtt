00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.400
<v Instructors>You would use AWS Budgets</v>

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.640
if you wanted to create a budget based on actual charges

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.860
or future estimated charges

4
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.760
and send alarms whenever your cost will exceed your budgets.

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.070
So you have four types of budgets you can set

6
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.000
in the budget console.

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.450
You can use usage, cost, reservation and savings plan,

8
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.220
and we'll see them in a second.

9
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.980
In case of signing a budget for a reserve instance,

10
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.700
you can track utilization of your reserve instances overall

11
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.430
and it supports RIs for different services

12
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.720
such as EC2, ElastiCache, RDS, and Redshift.

13
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.320
You can set up to five notifications per budgets

14
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.590
and you can filter your budget by many different options

15
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.170
such as service, linked account, tag, purchase options,

16
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.003
and so on.

17
00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:45.840
So that means that you get a lot of options,

18
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.760
actually the same as Cost Explorer,

19
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.730
and so that makes budgets something that is going

20
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.370
to be a lot more granular, a lot more flexible

21
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.960
when it comes to tracking your cost

22
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.330
and setting up alarms than, for example,

23
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.710
your billing alarms.

24
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.540
So the first two budgets are going to be free

25
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.210
and then you're going to pay 2 cents per day per budget.

26
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.620
So now let's go have a look in the console

27
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.820
to see how budgets work.
