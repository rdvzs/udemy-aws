00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.010
<v Instructor>So here I am in my console.</v>

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.420
And to get to the Health dashboard,

3
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.640
you can just click on this bell right here

4
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.320
and click on Event Log.

5
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.840
This will take you straight into your Health dashboards.

6
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.450
So first things first, let's look at Service Health.

7
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.790
So if you click on Service History,

8
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.070
this is going to give you the Service Health

9
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.070
of all the services in AWS by region, by day.

10
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.900
So you can see, for example, for North America,

11
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.480
we can look at Amazon EventBridge Scheduler

12
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.740
and see that today it was fine,

13
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.360
and yesterday was fine, and so on.

14
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.460
And you can scroll down and look at all the services,

15
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.010
and you can see that AWS is quite stable.

16
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.080
So you can find a specific service

17
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.380
or a specific region you want to drill into.

18
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.900
On top of it, in case you have open issues,

19
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.430
you will see them right here,

20
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.700
confirming the fact that maybe you are experiencing an issue

21
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.670
with a service and so are other customers.

22
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.280
But this is just general information.

23
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.762
For your Account Health,

24
00:00:54.762 --> 00:00:56.550
for the issues that are relevant to you,

25
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.580
you will find them in here in the Open and Recent Issues.

26
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.480
So when you have one,

27
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.070
you'll see the bell will have a little icon.

28
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.903
Right now there's none,

29
00:01:02.903 --> 00:01:04.980
because there is no open issues,

30
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.890
no schedule changes, and no other notifications.

31
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.650
But in case you have one, you'll see a bell here.

32
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.630
And this is going to give you the issues

33
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.400
that are impacting you right now.

34
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.490
For this tab, and for this tab, the Schedule Changes,

35
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.390
for example, they're gonna do

36
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.160
some maintenance on EBS volumes,

37
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.580
and that will impact you or other notifications.

38
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.650
And if you go into the Event Log,

39
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.390
you will find actually issues

40
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.320
that were opened and closed, and where,

41
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.690
the start time, and the last update time.

42
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.600
And these issues are received only applied to me,

43
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.840
because I was using underlying services.

44
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.630
So if I look at this Operational Issues for EC2,

45
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.660
you can click on it, you can view when it got started,

46
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.100
the fact it got resolved,

47
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.070
the description, and how it impacted me.

48
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.010
And on top of it, you could click on Affected Resources

49
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.910
to see the resources that were affected by this issue.

50
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:57.990
So, hopefully, you see the difference

51
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.260
between the Service Health and the Account Health.

52
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.080
And, finally, we have the Organization Health,

53
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.130
where you can configure it

54
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.500
to get organization-wide visibility

55
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.380
into the health of all your accounts.

56
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.750
And if you wanted to have automations,

57
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.190
you can integrate health

58
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.070
with Amazon EventBridge, for example.

59
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.100
Okay, so that's it for this lecture, I hope you liked it.

60
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.053
And I will see you in the next lecture.
