00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.200
<v Instructor>So now, let's talk about</v>

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.390
the AWS Health Dashboard.

3
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:04.223
So there are two parts.

4
00:00:04.223 --> 00:00:06.720
There is a Service History and then your accounts.

5
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.600
So the Service History will show you all the regions

6
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.250
and all the services' health.

7
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.083
It looks like this.

8
00:00:12.083 --> 00:00:15.090
So you can follow, based on the region you're in,

9
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.000
how a service behaved, if there was any issue with it.

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.800
And you can look at history.

11
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.600
So this is for each day

12
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.210
and there is an RSS feed you can subscribe to.

13
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.590
It used to be previously called

14
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.980
the AWS Service Health Dashboard.

15
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.160
So this is just general information.

16
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.000
The next one we have is the AWS Health Dashboard,

17
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.560
which is for your accounts.

18
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.760
So it used to be called

19
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.150
the AWS Personal Health Dashboard, PHD,

20
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.130
but now just Health Dashboard for Your Accounts,

21
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.010
and it'll provide you alerts and remediation guidance

22
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.830
when AWS is going to be experiencing events

23
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.873
that impact you directly.

24
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.750
So while the Service Health Dashboard

25
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.750
will display a general status of all your services,

26
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.330
the Account Health Dashboard will give you a view

27
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.700
for the performance and the availability

28
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.670
for the services that you're actually using

29
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.100
in your accounts and your resources.

30
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.470
It gives you relevant and timely information

31
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.690
and also gives you notifications

32
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.210
to proactively look out

33
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.090
for scheduled maintenance activities.

34
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.790
On top of it, within this Health Dashboard for Your Accounts

35
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.870
you can aggregate data for your entire AWS organization.

36
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.690
So to get access to your health dashboard,

37
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.720
just click on the top right corner next to the bell

38
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.800
and you'll have access to it.

39
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.770
So it's a global service and it will show directly

40
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.780
the outages that directly impact you.

41
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.540
You will get the event log to see past events.

42
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.160
And you can see, for example, on this one,

43
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.400
that there was an EC2 issue in US East 2

44
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.960
that could have impacted me.

45
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.540
So you'll get alerts, remediation information,

46
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.860
proactive notification

47
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.840
in case there is a scheduled change,

48
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.210
as well as scheduled activities.

49
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.140
Alright, that's it.

50
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.090
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
