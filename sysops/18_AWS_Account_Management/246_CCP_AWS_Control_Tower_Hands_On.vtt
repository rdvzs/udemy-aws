00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.610
<v Instructor>Let's go ahead and set up Control Tower.</v>

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.530
Now, this is not something

3
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.660
that I would recommend for you to do.

4
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.800
It is quite complicated.

5
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.450
It creates a lot of accounts

6
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.090
and there will be cost associated with creating

7
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.330
and using new services, which can be very, very costly.

8
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.160
So, I would really recommend for you

9
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.930
not to do this hands-on.

10
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.105
But for you to understand what Control Tower is,

11
00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:23.610
I'm going to perform the steps in front of you

12
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.950
and you get a better idea of how it works.

13
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.804
So, we're going to create a Landing Zone,

14
00:00:27.804 --> 00:00:30.090
and so as such, we have a Home Region.

15
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.520
This is where we are going to have

16
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.410
the home of Control Tower.

17
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.462
Then, you can deny access to a few regions

18
00:00:37.462 --> 00:00:41.310
by enabling the region deny setting, so you can enable it

19
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.520
and say, "Okay, some regions should be denied."

20
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.290
Next, you have additional regions for governance.

21
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.840
So which regions do you want to be monitored

22
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.100
for governance purposes.

23
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.720
Again, I'm going to use all the defaults

24
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.820
to keep things simple.

25
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.620
Next, we have the OUs.

26
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.760
So, the OUs are gonna be part of your organization

27
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.750
and there is a Security OU that is being created

28
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.670
for the log archive accounts

29
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.920
and the security audit accounts.

30
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.570
Then, we're going to get an additional OU

31
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.890
called the Sandbox.

32
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.680
This is where you can have your other accounts,

33
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.291
for example, and you can create more OUs

34
00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:14.613
after setting up your landing zone.

35
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.640
Okay, so next we have to create

36
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.970
those specific accounts for log and so on.

37
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.145
So, as you can see for the log archive accounts,

38
00:01:25.145 --> 00:01:28.257
you can create a new account and you have to enter an email.

39
00:01:28.257 --> 00:01:33.257
So for example, stephane+archive@example.com, right?

40
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.740
And this is the log archive accounts.

41
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.392
Next, we have the audit accounts.

42
00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:45.423
And so, we can have stephane+audit@example.com,

43
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.410
and then we click on Next.

44
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.021
So in terms of additional configurations,

45
00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:54.300
there is the AWS account access configuration.

46
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.000
So we can use IAM Identity Center to access

47
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.820
all the accounts within your control tower.

48
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.653
But if you wanted to,

49
00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:03.030
you can also do self-manage account access,

50
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.680
but it is way more complicated.

51
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.215
So again, I would suggest you use the default

52
00:02:06.215 --> 00:02:08.343
of using IAM Identity Center.

53
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.450
Next, we want to enable CloudTrail for everything,

54
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.060
and of course it is better to enable CloudTrail.

55
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.800
So, we'll have a look at CloudTrail

56
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.930
across our entire Landing Zone.

57
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.870
Then, do we want to send logs to Amazon S3?

58
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.950
This is optional.

59
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.633
I'm not going to touch any of these settings.

60
00:02:24.633 --> 00:02:27.120
And finally, do we want to have KMS encryption?

61
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.420
This is optional, but we could have a KMS key

62
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.890
to encrypt everything.

63
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.230
Overall, I'm not going to do this.

64
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.840
I just want to keep it simple for my Landing Zone.

65
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.330
So as we can see now, we have two OUs

66
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.770
created as part of my Landing Zone.

67
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.470
We have the Security and the Sandbox OU.

68
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.970
We have a management account.

69
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.640
We have log archive and audit accounts.

70
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.900
And then, we're good to go,

71
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.960
account access configuration, and perfect.

72
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.270
So, I understand that this will create a lot of resources

73
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.120
on my behalf and this can take a lot of time.

74
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.000
And so as such, I will be paying a lot of money if I do so.

75
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.993
So, I will click on Setup Landing Zone

76
00:03:01.993 --> 00:03:04.650
but you don't have to do it really.

77
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.650
It's just for you to watch this lecture.

78
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.600
So as you can see, the setup is going to take

79
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.850
about 60 minutes, and it's going to take a long time.

80
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.610
It's going to set up two OU, three shared accounts,

81
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.530
a native cloud directory with preconfigured group

82
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.910
and single sign-on access,

83
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.430
and 20 preventive guardrails to enforce policies,

84
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.600
and two detective guardrails

85
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.400
to detect configuration violations.

86
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.780
So, a lot of things are being set up.

87
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.990
I'm just going to wait a little bit until this is done.

88
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.480
Okay, so my Landing Zone is now available.

89
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.740
And it has set up two things.

90
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.450
Two organizational units,

91
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.035
three shared accounts with master accounts

92
00:03:36.035 --> 00:03:39.090
and isolated accounts for log archive and security audit.

93
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.850
There's a native cloud directory with single sign-on access

94
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.260
and I'll show you this in a second.

95
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.750
And then, 20 preventive guardrails to enforce policies

96
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.040
and two detective guardrails

97
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.080
to detect configuration violations.

98
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.770
So, a lot of things was created using Control Tower.

99
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.629
And if I go to Organizations right now,

100
00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.930
I can show you right away what was created.

101
00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:58.763
So as we can see here,

102
00:03:58.763 --> 00:04:01.800
we have the three accounts already in my organization.

103
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.510
And if I look to organize accounts,

104
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.300
we see there's custom and core organizational units.

105
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.180
So, in core we have the audit and archive.

106
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.910
And in the custom, we currently have no accounts, okay?

107
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.710
So, we shouldn't manage the accounts

108
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.670
through organizations though.

109
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.860
We should every time manage the accounts

110
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.390
through Control Tower.

111
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.130
And so, here are some recommendations.

112
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.820
So add or register OUs, configure your account factory,

113
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.250
more guardrails and review users and access,

114
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.420
and then review shared accounts.

115
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.090
So, a lot of things are happening here in this dashboard.

116
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.310
We get also access to non-compliant resources

117
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.440
based on the rules that we have defined.

118
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.880
We get some information

119
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.760
around the registered OU that have been created

120
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.290
and whether or not they're in compliance.

121
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.220
That's perfect.

122
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.670
As well as all the enrolled accounts into my accounts.

123
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.600
And for the guardrails,

124
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.150
we can view all the guardrails right here.

125
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.760
We can review guardrails, and so here we get the information

126
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.421
around all the rules that allow,

127
00:04:53.421 --> 00:04:56.400
that are enforced on our OUs, for example.

128
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.799
Disallow the deletion of log archive.

129
00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:00.960
Obviously that makes a lot of sense.

130
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.930
Disallow public read access to log archive and so on.

131
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.790
Disallow configuration changes to CloudTrail.

132
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.650
All these kind of things are excellent to have

133
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.840
and are set up by Control Tower

134
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.390
according to best practices, okay?

135
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.700
You could always create accounts right here.

136
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.563
So, you can view all the accounts here.

137
00:05:16.563 --> 00:05:19.380
And then in the OU you can, then show your OU,

138
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.480
and add an OU if you wanted to.

139
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.125
And here is the guardrails.

140
00:05:23.125 --> 00:05:26.460
The account factory is how you enroll an account

141
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.640
into your Control Tower, which is great.

142
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.570
Users and access.

143
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.910
So, this is how you manage the user access

144
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.730
to your whole account sets.

145
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.590
So, we have a single sign-on right here

146
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.778
and there is a user portal URL right here.

147
00:05:39.778 --> 00:05:42.900
And the way to handle user entity management right now

148
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.440
is with single sign-on, which is a service by AWS.

149
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.080
Shared accounts are here, landing zone settings, and so on.

150
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.420
So as we can see, this is a full management suite

151
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.680
for multiple accounts.

152
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.520
And so if we go into the SSO portal,

153
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.166
as we can see here there's a sign-in button.

154
00:05:58.166 --> 00:06:00.300
And then, there's a password that I have to share.

155
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.250
So, I'll just use the password that I have right here

156
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.990
that I've created from before.

157
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.650
And I sign in.

158
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.722
And now I am into my SSO.

159
00:06:07.722 --> 00:06:11.490
And I'm able to log into any of my three AWS accounts.

160
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.886
So, we have the audit accounts, the log archive accounts,

161
00:06:13.886 --> 00:06:15.270
and the Stephane CCP accounts

162
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.580
directly accessible from this UI.

163
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.350
So for example, if I want to go into the audits,

164
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.930
I can click here to go into the management console

165
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.510
of this audit account or click here for,

166
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.580
get the command line or programmatic access.

167
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.840
So it is really, really neat.

168
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.080
And here I go, I am into my audit account right now.

169
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.300
So it really shows you the power of Control Tower.

170
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.133
Now, it's not something

171
00:06:34.133 --> 00:06:36.210
that you would do on your own, obviously.

172
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.900
And now that I've moved away from my accounts

173
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:40.920
and then to reload my screen,

174
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.505
but this is to show you that,

175
00:06:42.505 --> 00:06:44.520
yeah it's quite handy I would say.

176
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.235
So, I'm just going to login back into my CCP accounts.

177
00:06:47.235 --> 00:06:50.700
It's quite handy to use Control Tower in your accounts

178
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.800
to set up multiple accounts going to best practices,

179
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.790
and manage it from there.

180
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.650
So, if you are an organization

181
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.770
that wants to have a multiple best practice AWS set up,

182
00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.570
then please use Control Tower.

183
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:01.403
Okay, that's it.

184
00:07:01.403 --> 00:07:02.236
I hope you liked this lecture

185
00:07:02.236 --> 00:07:04.110
and I will see you in the next lecture.
