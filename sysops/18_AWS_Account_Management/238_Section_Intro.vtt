00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.260
<v Instructor>Now we are getting into</v>

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.210
the AWS Account Management section

3
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.770
and in this section we'll see

4
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.803
all there is to know about Health Dashboards,

5
00:00:06.803 --> 00:00:09.230
AWS Organizations and the Billing Console.

6
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.600
There is no fancy diagram for these services

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.140
but they are asked on the exam from the SysOp perspective

8
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.900
and also whether it's SysOps in the real life,

9
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.960
you will need to know in and out these skills

10
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.910
to be able to be a great SysOps.

11
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.800
I'm really excited, this will be a short section

12
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.660
but I'm sure it will be full of learning.

13
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.613
Let's get started.
