00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.900
<v Instructor>So let's go through creating a billing alarm.</v>

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.970
And billing data is going to be stored in only one region.

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.010
It is us-east-1 and this is in CloudWatch.

4
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.160
But the data is going to be for your overall worldwide cost.

5
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.860
Okay. So not just for that one region.

6
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.050
It is only started in one region

7
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.240
but represents worldwide costs.

8
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.830
And it's actual cost incurred into your accounts,

9
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.380
not for project-specific costs.

10
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.023
So let's go ahead and create an alarm together.

11
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.050
So for this tutorial,

12
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.660
please make sure that you are selecting

13
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.180
US East Northern Virginia us-east-1 as an option,

14
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.600
because this is how you access your billing alarm.

15
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.353
Then you go into the CloudWatch console.

16
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.530
And to find your billing alarms,

17
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.060
you need to go on the left-hand side into Alarms

18
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.900
and then Billing.

19
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.770
So this only appears in us-east-1.

20
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.020
So this is where you can create your billing alarms.

21
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.580
And this is to see whether or not

22
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.590
you have alerts based on your actual spend.

23
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.040
So let's create an alarm

24
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.800
and then when you select metric.

25
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.120
And so here, the metrics are going to be related

26
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.403
to your billing.

27
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.240
Okay. So the first thing you have to do is

28
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.850
to enable billing alerts.

29
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.400
So let's go to my billing dashboard.

30
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.270
And then on the left-hand side,

31
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.470
we have Billing preferences.

32
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.310
And then we can click on Receive Billing Alerts.

33
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.550
And this is to enable monitoring the usage charges and fees.

34
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.540
So you need to enable this

35
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.640
and then you need to wait about 15 minutes

36
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.700
for your data collection to be active.

37
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.840
So I'm going to enable this and pause the video and wait.

38
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.930
Now that I've activated my billing alerts,

39
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.420
I can go into CloudWatch

40
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.220
and start looking at my billing data.

41
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.590
So we did about maybe two or three hours to get back to you.

42
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.973
So now if I go on the left-hand side, under Billing,

43
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.910
I can create an alarm

44
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.670
and select a metric.

45
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.910
And here I have access now to the billing metrics

46
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.370
and they would not appear if you did not enable

47
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.750
that tick box here

48
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.930
and give it some time to populate.

49
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.320
So we get By Service

50
00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.790
and so we can get a billing by service.

51
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.500
So if you wanted to control, for example,

52
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.440
your Amazon EC2 cost, you could just tick that.

53
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.290
And if you wanted to just look at your overall cost,

54
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.270
you would go one level up

55
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.710
and then you go Total Estimated Charges

56
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.400
and you would click on it.

57
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.540
Now, obviously there's not showing

58
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.870
something very, very interesting right now

59
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.780
because we only have one data point and it's $1.36.

60
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.760
So I don't spend a lot on my accounts.

61
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.870
But at least you could select this metric, for example,

62
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.287
and then you could, for example, define a condition,

63
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.120
being static,

64
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.470
and saying that if you become greater than $10 USD.

65
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.240
then please send me an alarm.

66
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.340
Okay. And the alarm could be, for example,

67
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.000
that you should send it out to an existing SNS topic

68
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.720
and create the relevant SNS topic.

69
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.240
So that's it for billing alarms.

70
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.160
I hope that makes sense.

71
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.280
So remember, you can set them at two levels.

72
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.160
You can send them on the metrics

73
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.970
at the overall spend for your accounts,

74
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.410
or you can also send it by service

75
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.150
and drill down for the service you want,

76
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.030
for example, Amazon S3, SNS, Config, and so on. Okay.

77
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.700
So that's it. I hope you liked this lecture.

78
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.650
And I will see you in the next lecture.
