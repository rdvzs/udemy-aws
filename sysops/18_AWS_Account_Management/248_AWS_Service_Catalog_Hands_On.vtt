1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.660
<v Educator>So let's start using the AWS Service Catalog.</v>

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.729
For this, first of all, I wanna show you something.

3
00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:07.470
It's on the Preferences.

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.300
You can actually update the branding

5
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.480
to customize the appearance of the console for the users.

6
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.530
So, as we can see right now,

7
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.940
we have the Service Catalog logo,

8
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.310
but you can actually put your own logo

9
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.005
and choose your own primary accent color

10
00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:21.000
as well as brand name.

11
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.220
To do so, it's supported only in some regions.

12
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.602
So, click on this if you don't have this.

13
00:00:24.602 --> 00:00:26.886
And then you need to submit a request right now.

14
00:00:26.886 --> 00:00:30.540
Enter all this information to AWS and click Submit,

15
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.478
and this is going to create a support ticket,

16
00:00:32.478 --> 00:00:34.590
then it's going to update your branding.

17
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.764
So we won't do it right now, but you get the idea,

18
00:00:36.764 --> 00:00:37.841
because the Service Catalog

19
00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:40.950
is a portal for your own company.

20
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.980
So now, let's go and create products for Service Catalog

21
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.750
before we deploy these products.

22
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.400
So on the left-hand side, we click on Product List,

23
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.980
and then let's Create a Product.

24
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.320
And we have multiple options. We can use CloudFormation.

25
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.520
That's the one we will use

26
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.220
to use native AWS CloudFormation templates,

27
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.780
but you can also use Terraform

28
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.970
with this option or that option.

29
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.200
But right now, it's out of the scope,

30
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.480
so let's just use CloudFormation.

31
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.075
So this one is going to be called LAMP Stack,

32
00:01:07.075 --> 00:01:08.580
and it's going to deploy.

33
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.580
The LAMP Stack, it's just a name for a specific stack.

34
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.252
And we're going to use CloudFormation,

35
00:01:13.252 --> 00:01:15.630
so this is my product name

36
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.690
and the owner is whoever is publishing this product,

37
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.820
so I'm going to use Stephane.

38
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.934
Now for version details, I have several options.

39
00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:25.590
I can specify a CloudFormation file,

40
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.270
and I will use a template file

41
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.380
that I will upload right now from my lamp-stack.json file,

42
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.680
which is in my code under Service Catalog.

43
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.775
So this is just a normal CloudFormation file,

44
00:01:36.775 --> 00:01:41.340
and I will call this version First Version.

45
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.562
Okay, great.

46
00:01:42.562 --> 00:01:45.420
So, next you can enter some support details.

47
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.981
So who within your company can be a point of contact

48
00:01:47.981 --> 00:01:50.580
for support in case the tech is not working?

49
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.480
So this is very helpful,

50
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.270
again, from a self-service perspective.

51
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.953
So, let's create this product.

52
00:01:57.533 --> 00:01:58.740
And it has been created.

53
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.966
Now, you need to add this product into a portfolio.

54
00:02:01.966 --> 00:02:04.680
So, we have local and imported portfolios.

55
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.840
Imported is when you want to import from other accounts,

56
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.360
and local is to create it for your own accounts.

57
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.190
So let's create a portfolio,

58
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.123
and I'll call this one WebDevPortfolio

59
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.660
because this is just for web developers.

60
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.620
Who is the creator name?

61
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.870
So, again, it's going to be Stephane,

62
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.630
and let's create this portfolio.

63
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.800
Now, within the portfolio,

64
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.140
as you can see, I can add products.

65
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.490
So, we can create product from here

66
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.830
or add a product to a portfolio.

67
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.140
And I will use my LAMP Stack product

68
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.740
that I have created from before.

69
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.953
Okay, so now my product has been assigned to my portfolio.

70
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.200
And so now we want to provide access to this portfolio.

71
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.390
So for this, let's have a look at the different options.

72
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.420
So, Constraints tells how you can add constraints

73
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.500
to how products are launched.

74
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.990
It's a bit advanced, but you can explore on your own.

75
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.964
The idea is that you can restrict

76
00:02:55.964 --> 00:02:58.590
the type of the options the users have

77
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.160
to make it even more simple for them or for extra safety.

78
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.328
Access is to give access

79
00:03:03.328 --> 00:03:06.990
to specific IAM Principles and Principle Names.

80
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.665
Sharing is to share with other accounts.

81
00:03:08.665 --> 00:03:10.110
And tags are for tagging.

82
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.530
So, let's go into Access and grant access.

83
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.580
So you have two options.

84
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.990
Either you choose IAM Principal,

85
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.760
this is for your own accounts,

86
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.675
or if you intend on sharing this with another account,

87
00:03:19.675 --> 00:03:22.350
you would use Principal Name.

88
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.729
So let's use IAM principle,

89
00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:25.884
and you have to choose which groups

90
00:03:25.884 --> 00:03:30.270
or which users should have access to our portfolio.

91
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.710
So, for example, here I have Stephane,

92
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.590
I have test, and I have admin.

93
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.030
So you have to add them one by one,

94
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.884
so let's just add users and grant access.

95
00:03:38.884 --> 00:03:40.290
In here, let's refresh.

96
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.315
You see you have two types of users that have access,

97
00:03:42.315 --> 00:03:45.022
but also I could just add admins if I wanted to

98
00:03:45.022 --> 00:03:47.553
and have also a group in there.

99
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.590
So now I have to log in

100
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.570
as my user Stephane for this account.

101
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.540
For this, I'm going to log out of this account.

102
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.155
So, I'm entering my account ID,

103
00:03:56.155 --> 00:03:58.740
my IAM username, and my password,

104
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.320
and then I click on Sign In.

105
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.930
So now, I'm signed in AWS.

106
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.873
And so, I'm going to go into Service Catalog.

107
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.210
And in there on the left-hand side, under Products,

108
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.030
as you can see, now I have access to my LAMP Stack

109
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.130
because I was authorized before.

110
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.560
So let's launch this product

111
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.720
and we're going to enter product name,

112
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.933
so DemoLaunchProduct.

113
00:04:23.466 --> 00:04:24.870
Product version is this one.

114
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.190
Database name is this.

115
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.640
Database password is going to be password123.

116
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.190
Again, password123.

117
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.040
DBUser is going to be Stephane.

118
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.160
The instance type is going to be t2.micro,

119
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.420
and SSHLocation is fine.

120
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.520
So, let's launch this product.

121
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.720
And behind the scene,

122
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.210
these were all CloudFormation parameters

123
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.830
that I've just entered.

124
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:47.663
And so, therefore,

125
00:04:47.663 --> 00:04:50.310
this is going to provision a CloudFormation stack.

126
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.370
So, if I go into the CloudFormation service now

127
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.740
and have a look at it, as you can see,

128
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.500
this stack is in Create in Progress,

129
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.490
and this is SC for Service Catalog.

130
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.790
So let's just wait until this is fully created.

131
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.110
So my stack is not created,

132
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.540
but I'm going to close CloudFormation

133
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.550
so to show you what was happening behind the scenes,

134
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.610
and, actually, let's refresh this page in here.

135
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.230
And so, for my Provision product,

136
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.520
this is the one we have launched.

137
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.570
As you can see,

138
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.870
we have a look at the resources that were created,

139
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.270
and we have a look at the events,

140
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.880
and we have a link to the CloudFormation stack,

141
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.520
and we also have a link to the outputs of it.

142
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.610
So, the website URL is right here,

143
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.073
and if I click on it right here.

144
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:37.353
Let's proceed.

145
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.450
As you can see, this is the welcome page

146
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.096
for my CloudFormation sample page for LAMP Stack,

147
00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:49.080
and this is just an example that shows that it works.

148
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.910
You don't need to do anything with it.

149
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.991
But we were able to successfully provision this product

150
00:05:53.991 --> 00:05:57.502
using Service Catalog, which is awesome.

151
00:05:57.502 --> 00:06:00.270
The outputs can also be found in this output tab.

152
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.103
And that's it.

153
00:06:01.103 --> 00:06:03.570
So you've seen how to have products,

154
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:04.590
how to launch this product.

155
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.540
Now, of course, to have no cost,

156
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.255
please delete and terminate this product,

157
00:06:10.255 --> 00:06:14.670
which is going to, in fact, delete the CloudFormation stack.

158
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.350
And you're going to be good to go.

159
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.658
So, just to summarize,

160
00:06:18.658 --> 00:06:20.880
we have in the administration side,

161
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.320
the product list that we create,

162
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.180
and we group them into portfolios

163
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.590
where we manage permissions,

164
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.600
and then from the user side,

165
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.984
we can see the products that have been assigned to us

166
00:06:29.984 --> 00:06:31.584
from a permissions perspective,

167
00:06:31.584 --> 00:06:34.830
and then we can provision them as we wish.

168
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.760
And that's it.
