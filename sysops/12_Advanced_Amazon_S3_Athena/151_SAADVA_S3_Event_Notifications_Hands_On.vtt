1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.930
<v Instructor>Okay, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.290
and demonstrate S3 Event Notifications.

3
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:04.980
For this, I'm going to create a bucket.

4
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.543
I call it "stephane-v3-events-notifications"

5
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.060
and then when Ireland's...

6
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.483
and I will just go ahead and create my bucket altogether.

7
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.200
Okay. So now bucket is created.

8
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.300
I'm going to go into it.

9
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.600
And what I'm going to do now

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.530
is make sure that event notifications are set up.

11
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.100
So I go to properties,

12
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.490
scroll down and then, here we have event notifications.

13
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.890
And as you can see, we have two options.

14
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.690
Number one is to create an event notification,

15
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.750
and I will show you this in a second,

16
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.210
or number two is to enable

17
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.430
the Amazon EventBridge integration

18
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.900
to send all the events

19
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.187
from this S3 bucket into EventBridge.

20
00:00:44.187 --> 00:00:46.210
And for this, you just you set it on

21
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.850
and you'll be good to go.

22
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.060
So it is something that now if I wanted to,

23
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.290
I could use Amazon EventBridge

24
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.980
to catch the events happening in my S3 buckets.

25
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.220
But I will show you the simpler way

26
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.870
because it's a bit more complicated,

27
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.180
is to just create an event notification

28
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.370
and send it for example to SQS.

29
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.340
So I'll call this one "DemoEventNotification"

30
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.480
and then we can set up a prefix, a suffix,

31
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.720
but I won't do it.

32
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.950
And next, we to choose event types.

33
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.310
So we want to react to all object create events.

34
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.680
So that means that any time an object is created,

35
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.470
then an event is going to be created.

36
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.700
But if you wanted to, you could get more granular

37
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.730
and select which type of events you wanted.

38
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.180
But to keep it simple, I'll take it here.

39
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.500
And you can also include for example,

40
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.440
object removals, object restores,

41
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.310
and it shows you all the events you can catch

42
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.550
on the right hand side.

43
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.740
So I'll keep it simple.

44
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.050
I'm just going to scroll down,

45
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.883
but as you can see,

46
00:01:38.883 --> 00:01:39.730
there are a lot of different events

47
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.560
you can react to in Amazon S3.

48
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.850
And then, you want to publish to a destination.

49
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.080
And so we have three options.

50
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.490
We have Lambda functions, SNS topic, and SQS queue.

51
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.300
And I'm going to choose SQS queue

52
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.110
but we first need to create a queue,

53
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.270
and then authorize Amazon S3

54
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.490
to publish messages into that destination.

55
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.430
So what I'm going to do now

56
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.430
is just go into Amazon SQS and then create a queue.

57
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.367
And I call this one "DemoS3Notification."

58
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.603
I will go ahead and create this queue.

59
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.920
And it's created.

60
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.540
So now wanting to do is to enhance the access policy

61
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.540
to allow my S3 bucket to write into my SQS queue.

62
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.480
So to do so, let me first demonstrate the problem.

63
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.810
So if I go back here

64
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.680
and I am going to refresh this page to see my queue appear.

65
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.447
So I refresh it and I say DemoS3Events.

66
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.670
All object created, and then scroll down

67
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.860
and then choose the SQS queue.

68
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.130
I can choose the queue ARN.

69
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.240
Sorry. I could choose queue here in the dropdown,

70
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.780
DemoS3Notification.

71
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.550
And if I try to save my changes,

72
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.777
I get an unknown error, which is saying that,

73
00:02:52.777 --> 00:02:55.890
"Hey, you are not able to validate

74
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.550
the destination configuration

75
00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.780
because this SQS queue does not accept yet messages

76
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.530
from my S3 buckets."

77
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.820
And so I need to change the access policy

78
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.063
by clicking on edits,

79
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.850
scroll down, here's my access policy.

80
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.660
And I need to go ahead and generate a new policy.

81
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.350
So I go to Policy Generator.

82
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.250
It's going to be an SQS queue policy.

83
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.500
And the effect is allow anyone, just to be very permissive,

84
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.810
to do a send message.

85
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.660
And my Amazon resource name is right here.

86
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.920
I need to copy it and paste it.

87
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.980
I add a statement, and then generate this policy.

88
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.120
And now, this is the policy I wanna use

89
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.750
which allows anyone to write to my SQS queue.

90
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.573
So it's very, very permissive, but it will work.

91
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.430
Let's save this.

92
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.400
And now my access policy has been updated.

93
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.810
So now, if I go back here and try to save my changes,

94
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.730
as you can see, the operation was successfully completed.

95
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.450
And what happened is that if I go into my SQS queue

96
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.290
and click on send and receive messages,

97
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.980
and then click on poll for messages,

98
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.130
as you can see, a message was being sent by Amazon S3

99
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.750
which is to test event, to test the connectivity.

100
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.833
So what I can do is I can take this message and delete it.

101
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.100
So now we want to test whether or not

102
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.920
the S3 Event Notification is working with SQS.

103
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.620
So therefore we're going to upload an object,

104
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.853
click on add files and choose our coffee, the JPEG.

105
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.023
I will upload this file.

106
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.280
Now the file has been uploaded.

107
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.420
And if I go into my bucket,

108
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.950
I can indeed see that my coffee, the JPEG, has been created.

109
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.470
And imagine we wanted to automate this

110
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.240
and create a thumbnail from it.

111
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.200
Then, we will need to have a message into our SQS queue

112
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.470
to then process it and create a thumbnail.

113
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.950
Therefore, I'm going to pull for messages.

114
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.950
And as you can see, a message was created here.

115
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.500
And if you look at the message itself,

116
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.490
and I'm going to try to increase this window size,

117
00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.870
we can see the fact that the "eventName"

118
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.880
was "ObjectCreatedPut"

119
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.180
So an object was indeed created.

120
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.970
And if we look deeper,

121
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.350
we're going to see that the key of that message

122
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.320
is coffee, the JPEG.

123
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.700
So the coffee, the JPEG, was created

124
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.540
and it generated a whole event into my SQS queue.

125
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.822
And therefore, that shows the power

126
00:05:18.822 --> 00:05:21.070
of S3 Event Notifications.

127
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.310
What I can do here is I can delete the message

128
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.620
and we're done.

129
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.453
Okay. So that's it.

130
00:05:25.453 --> 00:05:27.170
We've seen S3 Event Notifications.

131
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.290
What you need to remember again

132
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.590
is that you can send to SQS, SNS and Lambda,

133
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.270
as well as send all events to Amazon EventBridge

134
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.870
for further processing and sending it to more destinations.

135
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.180
Okay. That's it.

136
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.930
I will see you in the next lecture.
