00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.140
<v Instructor>So let me show you how to use S3 Glacier</v>

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.140
as a storage class from Amazon S3.

3
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.290
So if we take, for example, this copy of the JPEG file

4
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.410
and I'm going to do Action,

5
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.530
and then I can change its storage class.

6
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.850
So I can do Edit storage class.

7
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.510
In which case I can go into Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive.

8
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.730
So I'm going to go into Glacier. Okay.

9
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.210
And it has to stay there for at least 90 days.

10
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.200
Okay. So I will save my changes.

11
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.690
And now my object is being sent

12
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.140
into the Glacier storage class.

13
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.220
So this is good.

14
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.770
Now back in it, as we can see, the storage class has changed

15
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.603
for my objects.

16
00:00:32.603 --> 00:00:34.030
So in my coffee.jpg,

17
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.030
I can see in the bottom that the storage class is Glacier.

18
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.010
And what I can do is that I can initiate a restore for it.

19
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.810
So I can do right here.

20
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.930
The object is stored in the Glacier storage class.

21
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.460
And to use it, I can initiate a restore.

22
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.760
Now I can say how many days I want the restored copy

23
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.660
to be available.

24
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.060
So I can say one day I want it to be available. Okay.

25
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.790
So this will be available until that date.

26
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.860
And then I have three options for retrieval.

27
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.410
I have Bulk, Standard, and Expedited,

28
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.480
but if I do Expedited,

29
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.220
I need to purchase what's called capacity units.

30
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.910
So PCU to allow myself

31
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.390
to go and retrieve this file faster.

32
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.140
So we'll go into a Standard retrieval

33
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.780
of these specified objects,

34
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.230
and I can initiate a restore. Okay.

35
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.710
So as you can see, the restore has been initiated.

36
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.010
And for me to be notified of this restore,

37
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.200
well, I can use event notifications.

38
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.530
So you can see there is a restoration in progress

39
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.140
and it is going to be here,

40
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.160
is going to be in Standard retrieval.

41
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.470
So we're going to wait until this is done.

42
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.600
But if I want it to go into my bucket,

43
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.600
and then you go into Properties.

44
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.590
Scroll down and go to Event notifications.

45
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.020
I can create an event notification in my bucket

46
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.323
called RestoreNotifications.

47
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.833
And at the Event type,

48
00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:51.160
I'm going to look for is going to be around

49
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.320
the Restore object events.

50
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.020
So we have Restore initiated and Restore completed.

51
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.680
So this is when I initiate restore request

52
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.150
and it would have triggered a notification.

53
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.490
And restore completed is when I initiate,

54
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.910
I want the restoration soon as it is done.

55
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.260
And then I can send it as a destination

56
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.410
to a Lambda function,

57
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.540
an SNS topic,

58
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.810
or an SQS queue

59
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.780
and be notified accordingly.

60
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.010
So that's it. I will not create it.

61
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.420
But it gives you all the options on Glacier on AWS.

62
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.253
I hope you liked it.

63
00:02:18.253 --> 00:02:20.060
And I will see you in the next lecture.
