00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.890
<v Instructor>A very important cultural integration</v>

2
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.500
you need to know about is the one with Amazon EventBridge

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.540
to intercept any API calls.

4
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.660
So let's say you wanted to receive an SNS notification,

5
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.630
anytime a user would delete a table

6
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.070
in DynamoDB by using the DeleteTable API Call.

7
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.550
So what happens that whenever we do an API call in AWS,

8
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.250
as you know, the API call itself is going

9
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.050
to be logged in CloudTrail.

10
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.940
That's for any API call.

11
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.330
But then all these API calls will end up as events

12
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.250
as well in Amazon EventBridge.

13
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.390
And so we can look

14
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.660
for that very specific delete table API call,

15
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.400
and create a rule out of it.

16
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.008
And this rule will have a destination

17
00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:42.630
the destination being Amazon SNS

18
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.610
and therefore, we can create alerts.

19
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.740
<v ->So let me give you a few more examples</v>

20
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.890
on how you can integrate Amazon Eventbridge and CloudTrail.

21
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.900
For example, say, you wanted to be notified

22
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.620
whenever a user was assuming a role in your accounts.

23
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.430
So the AssumeRole is an API in the IAM service

24
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.250
and therefore, is going to be logged by CloudTrail.

25
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.290
And then using EventBridge integration,

26
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.160
we can trigger a message into an SNS topic.

27
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.890
Similarly, we can also intercept API calls that,

28
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.160
for example, change the Security Group inbound rules.

29
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.020
So the Security Group call

30
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.693
is called AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress,

31
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.240
and it's an EC2 API call.

32
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.210
So these are going to be logged again by CloudTrail

33
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.490
and then they will appear in EventBridge

34
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.370
and then we can trigger a notification in SNS.

35
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.620
So as you can see, the possibilities are endless,

36
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.940
but now you have a few ideas

37
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.920
of how the integration can be leveraged.

38
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.180
So I hope you liked it,

39
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.253
and I will see you in the next lecture.
