1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.880
<v instructor>So let's go into the config service</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.320
and start to configure it.

3
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.560
So we are in it and I'm going to click on get started

4
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.400
to start recording some settings.

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.290
So we're going to record

6
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.880
all the resources supported in this region,

7
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.080
but if you wanted to,

8
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.490
you can record only specific resource types.

9
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.000
In which case you can find resource categories

10
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.420
and then resource types on the right hand side.

11
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.630
But because I want to show you

12
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.340
all the resources I can record,

13
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.380
I'm going to click on this.

14
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.890
And on top of it, you can include global resources,

15
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.790
such as IAM users, group roles

16
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.490
and customer managed policies.

17
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.780
Just be aware that again,

18
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.980
config is not a part of the feature here,

19
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.720
so the more resources you record,

20
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.100
the more money you going to pay.

21
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.840
And so I'm doing this to show you everything to you,

22
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.090
but if you don't want to pay any money from this course,

23
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.790
please do not follow on with this hands-on.

24
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.460
Okay, so we're going to record our resources.

25
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.490
We're going to include global resources

26
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.820
and then to record all the resource configuration,

27
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.770
we need to create a config service linked role.

28
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.660
So we're going to click on that.

29
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.730
Then all this information is going to be delivered

30
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.900
into an Amazon S3 bucket.

31
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.070
So once you create a bucket,

32
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.860
and the bucket name is already entered for me,

33
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.920
so that's perfect.

34
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.850
And then we can have a prefix if you wanted to.

35
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.790
And then finally,

36
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.640
this is where the data is going to be stored.

37
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.920
And in terms of notification,

38
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.220
we can stream all the configuration changes

39
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.990
and notifications into an Amazon SNS topic if we wanted to,

40
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.030
and again, remember this is for everything into one topic.

41
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.220
But I don't wanna do this, so I will leave this unticked.

42
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.430
I click on next and next we find some AWS Managed Rules.

43
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.360
So we have a lot, as you can see,

44
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.610
and I want to define them later,

45
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.580
so I'm going to skip that part,

46
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.050
but you can have a look at them if you wanted to.

47
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.280
So click on next, and we can review the configuration.

48
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.640
So yes, we want to record all resources,

49
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.710
including global resources.

50
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.010
And we're going to deliver this into an S3 bucket

51
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.980
and currently we haven't defined any role.

52
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.590
So let's click on confirm.

53
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.580
Now the role is being created, the bucket is created

54
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.830
and then config is going to be started.

55
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.010
Now it's going to take a bit of time

56
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.270
for config to have a look at everything within your account

57
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.520
and look at the configuration.

58
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.020
So I'm going to post the video until this is done.

59
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.900
Okay, so my resources are still being discovered,

60
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.480
but I can go on the left hand side to resources,

61
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.460
and actually we will see

62
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.700
that some resources have already been discovered

63
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.410
in my account as you can see.

64
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.740
Some route tables, sub-net, VPC and so on,

65
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.180
have been discovered.

66
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.030
So what I can do is that I can look at resource type

67
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.040
and I can look for example, for EC2 security groups

68
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.890
and find that yes, my security groups are here.

69
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.840
And currently, they do not have a compliance status

70
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.390
because we haven't defined any kind of rule on top of them.

71
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.070
So let's have a look for example,

72
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.193
at one of these EC2 security group.

73
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.120
And from within the group,

74
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.730
we can have a look at the rules applied, so currently none.

75
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.580
And we could look at the configuration

76
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.950
of the security group itself, okay?

77
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.370
We can also look at the resource timeline.

78
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.510
And the resource timeline will give you

79
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.870
all the events related to that resource.

80
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.380
So there's a configuration change,

81
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.370
which is the initial right here.

82
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.450
There's some CloudTrail events also

83
00:03:03.757 --> 00:03:05.400
that were related to the security group.

84
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.289
For example, authorizeSecurityGroupingress rules,

85
00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:10.580
CreateLaunchConfiguration and CreateSecurityGroup,

86
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.413
this kinda thing.

87
00:03:11.413 --> 00:03:14.110
And we can go to CloudTrail to find these events.

88
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.680
So what I want to do is to figure out

89
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.480
whether or not my security groups are compliant or not.

90
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.470
And so for this, we're gonna go into rules.

91
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.210
And rules is going to be able to give us the option

92
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.043
to add a rule,

93
00:03:25.043 --> 00:03:27.720
and we can either add an AWS managed rule

94
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.890
or create our own custom rule with a lambda function.

95
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.460
So to keep it simple, I'm going to add an AWS managed rule

96
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.240
and let's have a look at rules that are accessible to us.

97
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.430
So one that I like is for example, approved-amis-by-id.

98
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.020
So this is to check whether running instances

99
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.043
are in your account using the specified AMIs.

100
00:03:45.043 --> 00:03:46.990
So if I click on it, for example,

101
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.510
and click on next, which is not related to security groups,

102
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.910
but I just wanna show you one rule.

103
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.170
So this one will check

104
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.500
whether or not your EC2 running instances,

105
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.870
will be using the specified AMIs.

106
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.430
And so you can trigger this

107
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.360
based on whenever a resource that's changed.

108
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.250
And then you can also specify all the EC2 instances in here,

109
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.220
and we have to specify a parameter for that rule,

110
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.260
which is the list of all the AMI IDs are approved

111
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.770
within their account and this is going to be used

112
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.610
by the rules and inputs to figure out

113
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.550
whether or not EC2 instance is compliant.

114
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.820
Because we do not have many EC2 instances yet,

115
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.140
we're not going to use that rule.

116
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.390
So instead we're going to use a managed rule,

117
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.570
but this time for SSH.

118
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.830
And this is going to be applied to our security groups.

119
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.170
So we want to make sure

120
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.790
that we're not allowing any incoming SSH traffic

121
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.150
from anywhere.

122
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.150
So we click on next, this is called the restricted SSH

123
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.460
and the trigger is going to be on our resource

124
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.190
whenever the configuration changes, okay?

125
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.610
But as we can see, if we define a different kind of rule,

126
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.270
we could have it to be run periodically as well.

127
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.220
So, okay, we're once.

128
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.770
Whenever our security group resource will change,

129
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.090
please evaluate that rule.

130
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.400
This is applying only to AWS EC2 security groups,

131
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.900
and we have no parameters for that row.

132
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.820
Click on next and click on add rule.

133
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.220
And now we have defined this first rule,

134
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.390
so let's have a look.

135
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.590
So currently it's not evaluated

136
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.420
and we don't have any remediation.

137
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.720
So let's wait a little bit until this is done.

138
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.260
So I just refreshed my page and as you can see,

139
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.620
an evaluation was done automatically.

140
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.570
And if we look at this rule,

141
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.410
we have seven security groups,

142
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.110
no six security groups right here,

143
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.150
which are not compliant.

144
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.033
So if we go into our resources on the left hand side,

145
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.060
and we're going to filter again by EC2 security group

146
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.200
and have a look at all our resources.

147
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.420
As we can see, some of them are compliant

148
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.730
and some of them are not compliant.

149
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.677
So if we look at the compliant and the non compliant one

150
00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:46.580
let's see the difference.

151
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.660
So this one is compliant, okay?

152
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.060
And a rule was applied to it as we can see

153
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.270
it says compliant.

154
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.870
So if I go and manage a resource

155
00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.360
and look at the inbound rules right here,

156
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.528
as we can see, we only have one inbound rule,

157
00:06:03.528 --> 00:06:06.120
which doesn't have a port, so there's no port 22 in here.

158
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.910
So this is why this is working.

159
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.620
But if I look at a non-compliant resource,

160
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.590
for example, this launch-wizard-3

161
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.787
I believe it was not compliant, okay?

162
00:06:13.787 --> 00:06:15.210
And you click on manage resource,

163
00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.640
we are taken again straight

164
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.770
into the console for security groups.

165
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.360
And if you look at the inbound rule,

166
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.360
as we can see, port 22 on IPv4 from anywhere is being open.

167
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.560
So this is a big problem.

168
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.560
So what I can do instead is delete this rule right here.

169
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.770
And if I delete this rule,

170
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.760
this will retrigger an evaluation of my resource,

171
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.050
which should make it compliant again.

172
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.850
So let's delete it and save my rules.

173
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.090
So then security group has been modified,

174
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.990
and so let me close this.

175
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.600
So this is my non-compliant security group,

176
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.150
and I can go into resource timeline to have a look.

177
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.760
And so within the resource timeline,

178
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.140
as we can see the configuration change happens,

179
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.170
and then the rule was run and it was not compliant.

180
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.710
Now I did change yet again, the configuration,

181
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.010
so we're going to have to wait a little bit of time

182
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.290
for the configuration change to happen right here,

183
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.990
which should trigger a rule compliance

184
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.110
and then hopefully now a resource will be compliant.

185
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.290
So let me pause a little bit and get back to you.

186
00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.470
So I have just refreshed my page,

187
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:23.700
and as we can see in here on July 12th,

188
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.280
we have after the rule compliance,

189
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.800
a CloudTrail event that happened

190
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.830
because I did revoke a security group ingress rule

191
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.330
because I deleted an ingress rule, that's true.

192
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.830
Then it recorded as well, a configuration change

193
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.950
saying hey, this rule that had the port 22 in it

194
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:42.150
got deleted so from and to is empty because it got deleted.

195
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.260
And then config, they run my rule again,

196
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.800
named restricted SSH.

197
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.150
And now my resource is compliant.

198
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.540
And so that means that yes,

199
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.740
I have fixed the compliance of my resource.

200
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.610
So I can go back into here

201
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.490
and we can have a look at another security group,

202
00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.030
for example, this one.

203
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.330
And under the rule here,

204
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.860
you can do action and then manage remediation.

205
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.190
So this is to remediate this for this rule,

206
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:08.080
so if you look at this rule,

207
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.580
we have manage remediation

208
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.420
and we can have manual remediation or automatic remediation.

209
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.050
In which case, you can specify your number of retries

210
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:19.720
and a number of seconds for the retries to happen, okay?

211
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.160
So we can select a manual remediation for example,

212
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.330
and then you need to choose a remediation action.

213
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.120
So these are SSM automation documents that we can select.

214
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.570
So these are defined by AWS, but we can also create our own.

215
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:36.360
And for example, well, we could delete a snapshot

216
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.230
or delete an image if it's not compliant

217
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:39.220
to whatever we wanted.

218
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.540
So it's really up to you to define the action you want.

219
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.940
So for example, you could say, hey attach EBS volume

220
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.690
and here's the right limit

221
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.080
based on the non compliant resources.

222
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.320
The resource ID parameters,

223
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.040
if you need them to be given to the remediation and so on.

224
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.250
Now this doesn't make any sense,

225
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.630
this remediation action, right?

226
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.060
We need to define a remediation action

227
00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.210
that makes sense for our rule,

228
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.560
but as you can see, we can set up automatic

229
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.310
or manual remediation and configure it and so on,

230
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:08.293
and also best in some parameters around the document itself.

231
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.420
So that's it for config, I hope you liked it.

232
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.440
And then aggregators is to integrate

233
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.780
across multiple accounts, okay?

234
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:16.760
And then under settings,

235
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.680
you can have a look at the settings we defined from before,

236
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.070
including, for example, sending all the data

237
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.580
into an SNS topic.

238
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.730
Or you can set up Amazon CloudWatch Event rules, okay?

239
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.110
From the CloudWatch consoles

240
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:28.710
or from the Events rules console

241
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.840
to intercept only specific non-compliant events

242
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.520
for some specific rules.

243
00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.510
So that's it for this section, I hope you liked it,

244
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.460
And I will see you in the next lecture.
