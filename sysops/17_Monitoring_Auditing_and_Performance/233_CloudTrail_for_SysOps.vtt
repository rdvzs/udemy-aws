00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.990
<v Instructor>Okay. So here are a few things</v>

2
00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.390
you need to know for CloudTrail

3
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.260
going into the exam.

4
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.610
The first one is that you can have

5
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.470
a log file integrity validation.

6
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.710
So when you do API calls within AWS,

7
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.550
they're going to be logged by CloudTrail

8
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.160
and you can have these logs

9
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.390
being sent into Amazon S3, okay, every one hour.

10
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.080
But, you can also create what's called a digest file.

11
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.770
And this is a file that will reference

12
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.540
all the log files from the last hour

13
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.460
and will contain a hash of each.

14
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.910
And this is going to be stored in the same S3 buckets

15
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.370
as your log files, but within a different folder.

16
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.480
And the idea is that,

17
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.309
this is going to reference all of them, okay.

18
00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.290
And this will help you determine

19
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.830
whether or not a log file was been tampered with.

20
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.150
So either modified or deleted

21
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.200
after CloudTrail delivered it.

22
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.250
So if the log file hash

23
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.690
corresponds to the digest file hash,

24
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.270
then you know for sure that the log file

25
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.740
has not been modified and you're good to go.

26
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.090
So this is very helpful for compliance purposes.

27
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.740
The hash is using the SHA-256 algorithm, okay.

28
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.520
And then the idea is that

29
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.220
you still want to protect your S3 buckets

30
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.310
using a bucket policy, using versioning,

31
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.728
using MFA Delete protection, encryption,

32
00:01:04.728 --> 00:01:06.870
and object lock if you wanted to make sure

33
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.190
that all these files within your S3 buckets

34
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.190
from CloudTrail are kept all along this time. Okay?

35
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.870
But if you want to show from a compliance perspective

36
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.940
that these files are not modified with,

37
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.380
you would use a digest file from CloudTrail.

38
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.420
Finally, you should protect CloudTrail using IAM

39
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.610
if you want to make sure

40
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.200
that CloudTrail keeps on delivering

41
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.750
these log files into Amazon S3.

42
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.150
You can also integrate CloudTrail with EventBridge.

43
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.510
So CloudTrail can trigger EventBridge

44
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.510
for any kind of API calls made within your AWS accounts.

45
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.533
And then from EventBridge,

46
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.640
you can do any kind of integration you want

47
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.970
using Lambda, SNS, SQS, and so on.

48
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.150
So if you want it to react to any API call, you know,

49
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.350
not even something that's covered by EventBridge,

50
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.890
but you know that will appear in CloudTrail,

51
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.940
then you would define an EventBridge integration

52
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.060
with CloudTrail.

53
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.940
But CloudTrail is not real-time, okay?

54
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.550
The events may be delivered within 15 minutes

55
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.870
of an API call

56
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.640
and then the events in log files

57
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.560
will also be delivered within S3 within 5 minutes. Okay?

58
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.880
So this is not a real-time automation

59
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.160
on top of API calls,

60
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.010
but this is for you

61
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.870
a way to get some kind of integration

62
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.430
on top of any API calls made within CloudTrail

63
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.060
when it is delivered into EventBridge.

64
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.820
Finally, you can have organization trails,

65
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.400
so, you can setup CloudTrail at the organization level.

66
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.750
So you have a management accounts

67
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.510
and many different member accounts.

68
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.960
And so your CloudTrail at your org level

69
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.670
is going to log events for all of API calls

70
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.010
for all your member accounts

71
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.620
into a target S3 buckets that is organization wide. Okay?

72
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.160
And this is very handy for account managements.

73
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.450
So all the events will be logged

74
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.730
and this is going to give you

75
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.570
for both the management and the member accounts,

76
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.200
and the trail name will be the same

77
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.810
for every accounts in AWS.

78
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.550
And the member accounts cannot remove

79
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.680
or modify the organization trail

80
00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.780
which is good for compliance.

81
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.150
They can only view that it exists.

82
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.320
So that's it for all the additional stuff

83
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.260
you need to know on CloudTrail.

84
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.300
I hope you liked it.

85
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.250
And I will see you in the next lecture.
