00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.890
<v Lecturer>So here is a very helpful service named</v>

2
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.050
Service Quotas.

3
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.480
So Service Quotas is a service that tells you

4
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.190
the quotas that you have within your accounts

5
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.330
and how close you are to reaching the thresholds.

6
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.800
The cool thing about it is that you can create

7
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.700
a CloudWatch Alarm on top of the Service Quotas console.

8
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.957
For example, like here, and you can say,

9
00:00:18.957 --> 00:00:21.170
"Hey, I want to monitor how many

10
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.280
Lambda Concurrent Executions I have."

11
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.420
And then you set up the alarm threshold.

12
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.340
And in case you reach that threshold,

13
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.520
then you're going to get a notification.

14
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.640
So the Service Quota can monitor, for example,

15
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.130
any kind of quota available within your accounts,

16
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.210
for example, the Lambda Concurrent Execution quota.

17
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.070
And then if you go over 900,

18
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.180
and the limit is 1000 by default,

19
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.450
then you should trigger a CloudWatch Alarm.

20
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.490
And this will tell us as Administrators that we should

21
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.980
probably request a quota increase

22
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.750
for the Lambda Concurrency Execution,

23
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.810
because that means that we're maybe about to be

24
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.490
getting some kind of throttling.

25
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.880
And so this is super, super helpful,

26
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.560
not just for Lambda Concurrent Executions,

27
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.300
but for any kind of actions that may result in some errors

28
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.300
or some throttling.

29
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.310
The alternative is to use

30
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.400
Trusted Advisor with CloudWatch Alarms,

31
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.020
but Trusted Advisor is a less complete solution because

32
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.100
there's only a limited number of service limits checks

33
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.490
happening in Trusted Advisor, about 50.

34
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.670
And so that means that Trusted Advisor will only get a few

35
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.020
limits to be able to be monitored.

36
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.920
And all the results will still be in CloudWatch though

37
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.210
so if you want it to have a look at some service limits,

38
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.340
you can link it to CloudWatch and then again,

39
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.930
trigger a notification.

40
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.810
But I would recommend to use CloudWatch Alarms

41
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.390
mostly on the Service Quota service

42
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.020
because this is dedicated to monitoring all of your quotas

43
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.120
within your accounts.

44
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.673
So I will see you in the next lecture for some practice.
