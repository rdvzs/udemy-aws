00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.070
<v Instructor>So one very popular exam question</v>

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.110
is to make the distinction

3
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.720
between CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and Config.

4
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.680
Now thankfully, thanks to the hands-on,

5
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.300
hopefully you know exactly what are the differences are.

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.650
It's pretty obvious in my opinion,

7
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.930
but it's never too bad

8
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.860
to go through an example and see them.

9
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.070
So CloudWatch is for performance metrics,

10
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.250
metrics, CPU, network, and to create dashboards.

11
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.120
You can also get events and alerts,

12
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.410
and finally, we have a log aggregation and analysis tool

13
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.420
if we wanted to.

14
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.550
So CloudWatch, I think we're all pretty familiar with it,

15
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.910
this already.

16
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.410
Now, CloudTrail could be new to you,

17
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.230
but basically it's to record API calls

18
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.740
made within your account by everyone and everything,

19
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.670
and you can define some trails for specific resources,

20
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.150
so you can get more information on EC2 only,

21
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.170
and it's a global service.

22
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.740
Now finally, Config is to record configuration changes

23
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.670
and to evaluate resources configuration

24
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.410
against compliance rules.

25
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.340
Finally, you're going to get a timeline

26
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.050
of changes and compliance with its nice UI.

27
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.400
So, I think they're a very distinctive service

28
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.880
I don't think there's any confusion,

29
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.370
but let's go through an Elastic Load Balancer

30
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.990
to see how each of these service

31
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:08.420
can help you understand what is happening to your ELB.

32
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.000
So CloudWatch can monitor

33
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.860
the number of incoming connections,

34
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.570
can visualize number of error codes

35
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.890
as a percentage over time,

36
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.720
and maybe we can have a dashboard

37
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.040
to get an idea of the load balancer performance,

38
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.920
maybe we can have a,

39
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.620
even make it a global dashboard

40
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.090
if you have multiple load balancers

41
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.130
for a global application.

42
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.510
Now, Config, why would we use Config on the ELB?

43
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.630
Well, maybe you wanna track

44
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.610
the security group rules for the load balancer,

45
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.290
making sure no-one does anything fishy or changes anything,

46
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.330
maybe you want to change also a track

47
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.820
that configuration changes for the load balancer itself,

48
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.310
to see if anyone modifies the SSL certificate,

49
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.880
or et cetera, et cetera.

50
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.740
We also maybe have a rule to say,

51
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.690
oh there's always should be an SSL certificate

52
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.170
assigned to the load balancer,

53
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.100
and maybe we should never allow

54
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.610
non-encrypted traffic into the load balancer,

55
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.330
that could be two different compliance rules

56
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.970
that you put into Config.

57
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.540
Finally, CloudTrail will be to track who made any changes

58
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.820
to the load balancer with API calls.

59
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.940
So, in case someone changes the security group rules

60
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.820
or someone changes the SSL certificate,

61
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.330
or removes it, or whatever,

62
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.370
then CloudTrail will be how we know who made these changes.

63
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.530
So all these tools are complementary when you think about it

64
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.370
and when you understand that,

65
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.910
how they're used for a load balancer,

66
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.620
which I think is a great example,

67
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.110
then you are going to rock any questions

68
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.220
asked for you at the exam.

69
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.320
So I hope that makes sense,

70
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.270
and I will see you in the next lecture.
