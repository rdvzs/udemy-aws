00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.240
<v Instructor>So let's have a look at CloudTrail.</v>

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.630
And CloudTrail is a service to intercept any API calls

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.810
or user activity within your accounts.

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.260
And so here on here on the left hand side panel,

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.110
we can have a look at the event history

6
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.850
and this is the event history

7
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.700
for the last 90 days of management events.

8
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.010
So you can see all the API calls that are being made

9
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.720
over time in this account.

10
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.750
So it doesn't have to be very interesting, okay,

11
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.670
but all of them will be here.

12
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.370
So what I wanna do for example, is that I want

13
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.660
to look in my EC2 console, and I created a demo instance.

14
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.980
And what I'm going to do is that I'm going

15
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.870
to terminate this instance.

16
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.420
So I do right click, terminate,

17
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.970
and now the instance is being terminated.

18
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.070
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to check whether

19
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.210
or not this event happens and appears within CloudTrail.

20
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.543
So I'm going to wait about five minutes and get back to you.

21
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.471
And so I just refreshed my pages, and as you can see,

22
00:00:57.471 --> 00:01:01.590
I ran the terminate instances, API call.

23
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.540
And we can see what's the event source.

24
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.120
So it's EC2 from where it was done,

25
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.470
the access key that was used,

26
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.600
the region that was used, and so on.

27
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.820
And we can get the whole event right here.

28
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.460
So that's the full power of CloudTrail is

29
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.010
that we can see all the events really happening

30
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.290
from within CloudTrail directly in this UI.

31
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.290
And this is a short introduction at the practitioner level,

32
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.360
but this is enough for you to get started

33
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.532
and to answer questions at the exam.

34
00:01:26.532 --> 00:01:27.840
So that's it.

35
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.673
I hope you liked it.

36
00:01:28.673 --> 00:01:30.570
And I will see you in the next lecture.
