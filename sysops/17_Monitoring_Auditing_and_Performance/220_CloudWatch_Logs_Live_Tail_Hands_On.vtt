00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.170
<v Lecturer>So I want to show you</v>

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.230
a really cool CloudWatch logs feature called Live Tail.

3
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.000
So first let's create a log group

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.480
and I'll call this one demo log group

5
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.250
and then create it.

6
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.480
We click on it and then we're going

7
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.783
to create a log stream called DemoLogStream.

8
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.680
Let's create it and click on it

9
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.940
and then we are in it.

10
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.170
So we can start tailing.

11
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.840
Here's the button start tailing and what this means,

12
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.320
and I will just keep the other one open in the back page.

13
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.800
So we have access to here our log stream,

14
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.960
and here we clicked on Live Tail

15
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.730
and we are in the Live Tail setting.

16
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.800
So here this is a Live Tail UI

17
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.360
and we have filtered on a specific demo log group

18
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.430
and then demo log stream as a log stream.

19
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.263
This is optional.

20
00:00:45.263 --> 00:00:48.330
You can choose to specify or not a log stream.

21
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.950
Then you apply your filter

22
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.840
and this is going to wait for log events

23
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.670
that match your filter.

24
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.710
So that means that as events are being posted

25
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.790
into Cloudwatch logs,

26
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.250
they are going to appear here in our Live Tail,

27
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.860
which could be very helpful for your debugging needs.

28
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.970
So let's do an example.

29
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.150
So we're going to go into our

30
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.580
demo log stream again, in here,

31
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.880
and under actions we're going to create a log event

32
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.710
and we'll have hello world

33
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.170
so we can create a log event and post it.

34
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.520
So now hello world has been posted

35
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.410
and if you go into your Live Tail,

36
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.420
as you can see it has appeared.

37
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.500
So this is quite a nice way

38
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.660
because if you have log streaming very fast,

39
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.220
it can all appear here.

40
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.070
And then from this we can get more information

41
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.400
around when this happened, the group and so on.

42
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.510
And then we can click here

43
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.810
to get a link into the direct log stream it happened into.

44
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.160
So it's just a very cool,

45
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.640
very easy feature to debug your CloudWatch logs.

46
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.260
And from a pricing perspective,

47
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.940
you only get a few hours a day,

48
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.970
so maybe one hour a day of free usage of Live Tail.

49
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.350
So please make sure to cancel

50
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.090
and close your lifestyle session

51
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.500
so that you don't have any cost,

52
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.090
but you have one hour of free every day.

53
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.440
So this is quite nice.

54
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.330
Alright, so that's it for this lecture.

55
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.470
I hope you liked it

56
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.453
and I will see you in the next lecture.
