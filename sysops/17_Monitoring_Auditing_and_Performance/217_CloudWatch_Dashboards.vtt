1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.070
<v ->Now that we have metrics it's possible for us</v>

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.810
to present them into a CloudWatch dashboard.

3
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:05.930
So it is very easy.

4
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.800
You can access to your key metrics and your alarms

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.410
and the dashboards are going to be global.

6
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.550
So they're going to be across many regions

7
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.300
and you can include graphs from different accounts in AWS

8
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.140
or different regions.

9
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.390
And this is very important from an exam perspective.

10
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.460
You can have metrics from US east one and then EUS one,

11
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.770
and then AP Southeast two in the same CloudWatch dashboard.

12
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.630
You can change the time zone and the time range

13
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.463
on the dashboard,

14
00:00:27.463 --> 00:00:28.900
you can set up automatic refresh,

15
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.530
and you can share the dashboard with people

16
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.270
who do not have an account in AWS.

17
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.300
The pricing is very easy.

18
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.780
You'll get three dashboards up to 50 metrics for free,

19
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.613
and then you're going

20
00:00:37.613 --> 00:00:40.270
to pay $3 per dashboard per month afterwards.

21
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.440
So let's go ahead and see how we can create a dashboard.

22
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.640
So let's go ahead and have a look at our dashboards.

23
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.340
So right, currently we have zero custom dashboards,

24
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.461
but we can create an automatic dashboard based

25
00:00:49.461 --> 00:00:51.000
on a specific service.

26
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.430
So you could create, for example,

27
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.010
an auto-scaling dashboard,

28
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.460
and this would create already a pre-configured dashboard

29
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.480
for you, which you can filter by resource group.

30
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.850
For example, DevGroup, FinanceGroup, ProdGoup

31
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.560
and we had created these groups from before.

32
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.467
And then this would show you all the metrics

33
00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:06.490
that AWS thinks is relevant

34
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.900
for your auto scaling group, okay?

35
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.860
But this is,

36
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.240
these are your automatic dashboards.

37
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.510
What you can do instead

38
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.980
is you can create a custom dashboard.

39
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.370
So if you go to dashboard and then create a dashboard,

40
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.770
you can create a demo dashboard.

41
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.160
Now in here, you can add many different things.

42
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.470
You can add a line, a stacked area, a number, some texts,

43
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.940
some logs table, alarm status, and so on

44
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.180
so lots of different widgets that you can use

45
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.300
within your dashboard.

46
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.810
So for now I'll use a number and I'll use a number, why?

47
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.980
Because we pushed a custom metric in my namespace

48
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.450
and then we choose this number.

49
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.150
And this is going to show you the size of my buffer.

50
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.770
So this is quite handy and it will create this widget.

51
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.020
So remember this number was pushed using the put

52
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.420
metric data API code that we used from before

53
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.020
from the documentation in this CLI.

54
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.820
So here we have this number and it's pretty cool,

55
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.810
but for example,

56
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.650
you wanted to add another widget or you can have,

57
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.250
for example, a line and a metric,

58
00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.610
and then you choose a metric.

59
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.680
For example, again,

60
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.050
you see two and you get your per instance metric

61
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.170
and you get your CPU credit balance, and you can add it.

62
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.600
Now, we don't have any information right now

63
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.010
in this dashboard because, well,

64
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.730
we don't have any EC2 instances is running.

65
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.700
And so therefore this credit balance

66
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.690
for that EC2 instance is not happening

67
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.130
to be populated, okay?

68
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.010
But you could go back in time again

69
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.713
and display one month of data.

70
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.360
And this would show you a little bit of information

71
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.420
and you can zoom in.

72
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.290
And as you can see, as I zoom in, well,

73
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.080
the buffer did not show any data

74
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.610
because during that timeframe that I'm zooming in right now,

75
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.860
well, the buffer that was a custom metric

76
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.900
did not have any data.

77
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.950
So you can definitely have a look at CloudWatch dashboards.

78
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.470
And the cool thing is that all the metrics

79
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.030
and all the widgets that you're sharing side to side

80
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.240
are going to be shown during the exact same timeframe.

81
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.740
So you can get a more complete information around the story

82
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.490
of your metrics as you go and explore your dashboard, okay?

83
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.110
So right now I can just display the last one hour

84
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.000
and I can just save this dashboard,

85
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.833
and then we'll be good to go.

86
00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:01.666
So we can say, hey,

87
00:03:01.666 --> 00:03:06.580
show me the last 180 minutes and she should be good to go.

88
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.413
Okay.

89
00:03:07.413 --> 00:03:09.490
So now you can also do something else for your dashboard.

90
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.720
I told you dashboards are global.

91
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.060
So therefore you can add a widget

92
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.810
and you can add a line again, okay?

93
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.670
A metric.

94
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:17.570
But this time, as you can see,

95
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.490
the metric can be chosen from any specific regions.

96
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.370
So right now we're in Frankfurt,

97
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.050
but if you go to US east one,

98
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.110
you could find some metrics around US east one.

99
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.100
For example, some storage metrics of a bucket,

100
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.400
and you can get the buckets sized bites and plot that

101
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.580
or the number of metrics, a number of objects, for example,

102
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.220
and add this directly.

103
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.640
So this metric right here comes from US east one.

104
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.960
Even though there is no data available.

105
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.580
So not very, very interesting, but as you can see,

106
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.520
metrics can come from different regions

107
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.670
in the same CloudWatch dashboard, which is quite handy.

108
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.503
Okay.

109
00:03:48.503 --> 00:03:49.820
And then when you're done with the dashboard,

110
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.440
make sure you save your dashboard

111
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.840
to have it saved and therefore all

112
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.070
the changes you've done are going to be permanent, okay?

113
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.450
So let's say for CloudWatch dashboard,

114
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.740
just remember multiple accounts, multiple regions,

115
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.573
that's very important.

116
00:04:01.573 --> 00:04:03.590
And you can show multiple widgets just by clicking

117
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.010
on the add widget button,

118
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.780
including for your custom metrics, okay?

119
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.760
So hope that was helpful.

120
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.710
And I will see you in the next lecture.
