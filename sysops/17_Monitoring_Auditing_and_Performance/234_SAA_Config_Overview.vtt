00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.660
<v Instructor>Okay, let's have a look at AWS Config.</v>

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.700
So Config is a service that allows you to get auditing

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.560
and record compliance of your resources in AWS,

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.990
based on some rules that you're going to set,

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.830
you can also record Configuration

6
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.660
and their changes over time

7
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.450
to quickly be able to roll back and to figure out

8
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.610
what happened in your infrastructure if you need to.

9
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.460
So some questions that can be solved by Config are,

10
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.160
is there an unrestricted SSH access to my security groups?

11
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.800
Or do my buckets have anybody public access?

12
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.910
Or is there an ALB configuration that has changed over time?

13
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.030
Then based on these rules being compliant or not,

14
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.240
you can receive alerts or SNS notifications for any changes.

15
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.822
Config is a per region service,

16
00:00:43.822 --> 00:00:45.690
so you need to configure it for all the regions

17
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.830
if you need to,

18
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.530
and you can aggregate the data across regions and accounts

19
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.180
to centralize it into one place,

20
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.710
you can also can store the configuration

21
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.030
of all your resources into Amazon history

22
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.070
to be later analyzed,

23
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.950
for example, by serverless query engine, such as Athena.

24
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.320
So what types of rules go into Config?

25
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.160
Well, you can have AWS managed config rules,

26
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.440
and there are over 75 rules that you can use,

27
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.510
or you can create your own config rules.

28
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.950
In this case, you need to define that rule yourself.

29
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.870
We're using a Lambda function.

30
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.190
For example, you can evaluate if each EBS disk

31
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.370
is going to be of type gp2

32
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.600
or if each two instance in your development accounts

33
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.500
is of type t2.micro.

34
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.520
Some rules can be evaluated or triggered

35
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.530
whenever a configuration is going to change.

36
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.160
So whenever, for example,

37
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.040
you have a new configuration of your EBS disc,

38
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.140
please evaluate the type of your EBS disk,

39
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.840
or you can also have the rule to be evaluated

40
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.210
at regular time intervals.

41
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.720
For example, every two hours,

42
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.220
please make sure that all my EBS discs are of type gp2.

43
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.500
Now, Config Rules are just for compliance.

44
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.730
They do not prevent actions from happening.

45
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.130
This is not a denied action on anything.

46
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.410
It doesn't replace security mechanisms such as IAM.

47
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.410
Okay, but what it does give you is a overview of your

48
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.000
configuration and the compliance of your resources.

49
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.440
Now there's no future for config.

50
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.200
It can be quite expensive very quickly.

51
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.300
You're going to pay 0.003 cents per configuration,

52
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.010
item recorded per region and 0.001 cents per config rule

53
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.250
evaluation per region.

54
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.660
Now for the company resource,

55
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.320
you're going to be able to view the compliance

56
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.800
of a resource over time.

57
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.000
For example, the security group has been non-compliance.

58
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.830
Then you can view the config resource configuration

59
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:28.760
over time, okay?

60
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.620
You can see when the change and who changed it and so on,

61
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.290
and you can link it to CloudTrail to view the API calls

62
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.860
made for that resource.

63
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.380
So you can get a full picture

64
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.690
of everything that's happening.

65
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.180
Now, although you cannot deny any action from happening

66
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.530
from within the config,

67
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.140
you can do remediations of your non-compliant resources

68
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.750
using an SSM Automation Documents.

69
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.030
So the idea is, for example,

70
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.730
you are monitoring whether or not

71
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.950
your IAM access keys have expired.

72
00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.900
For example, they are older than 90 days.

73
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.300
In which case you want to mark them as non-compliant.

74
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.000
So this will not prevent them from not being compliant,

75
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.157
but you can trigger whenever a resource is not compliant,

76
00:03:10.157 --> 00:03:12.340
a remediation action.

77
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.128
For example, there's an SSM document

78
00:03:14.128 --> 00:03:18.190
named RevokeUnusedIAMUserCredentials, okay.

79
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.020
Maybe you want to use this one

80
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.447
and then is going to be applied

81
00:03:22.447 --> 00:03:24.580
to whatever resource you have, okay?

82
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.440
And in this instance,

83
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.870
it's going to deactivate your IAM access keys.

84
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.610
So the idea is that's either using either using

85
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.670
AWS-Managed Documents

86
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.880
or creating your own automation documents,

87
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.080
you can have remediations

88
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.490
of your non-compliant resources, okay?

89
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.780
And if you want it to and go all the way through

90
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.670
with the scripting,

91
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.950
you could create a document

92
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.710
that will invoke a Lambda function

93
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.441
and you're free to do whatever you want there.

94
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:50.730
Finally, your remediation may have retries.

95
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.900
So in case the resource is still non-compliance

96
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.580
after an auto remediation, it may retry for example,

97
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.633
up to five times.

98
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.760
So lastly, what about notifications?

99
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.160
Well, we can use if EventBridge to trigger notifications,

100
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.760
whenever our resources are not compliant.

101
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.593
So, for example,

102
00:04:06.593 --> 00:04:09.290
we monitor our security group, it becomes not compliance.

103
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.730
Then we can trigger an event in EventBridge,

104
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.270
and then pass it on to whatever resource you wants.

105
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.969
Or you can also pass on all the changes

106
00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:19.460
and all the compliance that notifications

107
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.500
of your resources to SNS from Config.

108
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.610
So one configuration item,

109
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.480
and then if you want it to just filter

110
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.770
for only for some events,

111
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.860
you could use an SNS filtering to have a filtered SNS topic,

112
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.870
and then you can send it these notifications, for example,

113
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.800
to an admin email or to a slack channel and so on

114
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.170
to get all these notifications in one place.

115
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.510
So that's it for a Config.

116
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.343
I hope you liked it,

117
00:04:42.343 --> 00:04:44.783
and it will see you in the next lecture for some hands-on.
