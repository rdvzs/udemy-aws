00:00:00.081 --> 00:00:04.170
<v Narrator>So let's have a look at the service quota,</v>

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.708
service type service quotas,

3
00:00:05.708 --> 00:00:07.890
and go to the service itself.

4
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.553
So here we can manage the quotas of all our services

5
00:00:10.553 --> 00:00:13.120
and have a look at the limits that are in place.

6
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.540
So I'm going to click on every services,

7
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.170
and here are all the services on AWS,

8
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.250
which is quite nice.

9
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.260
And I'm just going to find one that's simple to understand.

10
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.983
For example, AWS Lambda.

11
00:00:23.983 --> 00:00:26.153
So here we have the service quotas for Lambda,

12
00:00:26.153 --> 00:00:27.865
and we can see that there are some limits.

13
00:00:27.865 --> 00:00:30.990
For example, the asynchronous payload is limited

14
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.170
to 256 kilobytes, and we cannot adjust it.

15
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.621
That's why it is grayed out.

16
00:00:35.621 --> 00:00:37.192
But some options, for example,

17
00:00:37.192 --> 00:00:40.440
the concurrent executions is not greater.

18
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.180
So I can click on it, and I can adjust it.

19
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.282
For example, here at the account level.

20
00:00:44.282 --> 00:00:47.820
So we click on it and we have information.

21
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.860
For example, it's been used one count.

22
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.460
That means that we use approximately one of the quota

23
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.841
out of the 50 that is applied as a limit on my account.

24
00:00:56.841 --> 00:00:59.185
And the maximum value here,

25
00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:01.170
or default value is 1000.

26
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.078
So we can adjust it.

27
00:01:02.078 --> 00:01:04.934
For example, we can request an increase at account level,

28
00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:06.930
and now we're at 50.

29
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.577
But for example, we can increase 400.

30
00:01:09.577 --> 00:01:12.720
And so from some services, the smaller increases

31
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.048
are going to be automatically approved.

32
00:01:14.048 --> 00:01:16.819
For the larger ones, they're submitted to the support.

33
00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:19.110
And if it's a support, there is a timeline.

34
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.526
It takes time, and you need to wait a little bit.

35
00:01:21.526 --> 00:01:24.097
So you could include it to a hundred if you wanted to.

36
00:01:24.097 --> 00:01:26.730
The other thing you could do is to monitor this.

37
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.580
So you can see here,

38
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.060
we have the concurrent executions here, graph.

39
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.143
So I use it barely,

40
00:01:31.143 --> 00:01:33.389
but if I wanted to, I could create an alarm

41
00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:34.977
if I approach my limits.

42
00:01:34.977 --> 00:01:36.944
For example, here on the CloudWatch alarms,

43
00:01:36.944 --> 00:01:38.382
I can create an alarm.

44
00:01:38.382 --> 00:01:40.896
And we say, okay, when we're at 80%

45
00:01:40.896 --> 00:01:42.914
of the applied quota value,

46
00:01:42.914 --> 00:01:47.340
then alarm quota,

47
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.760
Lambda, concurrent

48
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.793
execution.

49
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.670
Here we go.

50
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.600
And so we create an alarm

51
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.480
that will trigger at 80% of the quota.

52
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.740
That could be helpful for us, for example,

53
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.930
to know that we should improve the quota

54
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.056
in order not to get limited.

55
00:02:02.056 --> 00:02:04.844
So the alarm is created, but we can configure the actions

56
00:02:04.844 --> 00:02:06.471
by clicking on this green button.

57
00:02:06.471 --> 00:02:07.802
And this will take us directly

58
00:02:07.802 --> 00:02:10.165
into the CloudWatch alarms UI.

59
00:02:10.165 --> 00:02:12.341
And so I can do action edits.

60
00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:15.316
And in there on step two, I can configure the actions

61
00:02:15.316 --> 00:02:17.613
and for example, send a notification

62
00:02:17.613 --> 00:02:22.613
when we are an alarm to an SMS topic, demo topic.

63
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.500
And then we'll receive an email if we have an email set up

64
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.450
on this SMS topic

65
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.273
and then save it.

66
00:02:29.273 --> 00:02:31.890
And now we have an alarm on the quota.

67
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.510
So these quotas are extremely helpful

68
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.640
because well, we're going to get, first of all,

69
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.873
the monitoring of the values of the quotas,

70
00:02:37.873 --> 00:02:40.068
and then we can get alarms if we think that a quota

71
00:02:40.068 --> 00:02:41.287
is going to reach a limit,

72
00:02:41.287 --> 00:02:43.243
which is great when you work in an enterprise.

73
00:02:43.243 --> 00:02:44.880
All right, that's it for this lecture.

74
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.713
I hope you liked it,

75
00:02:45.713 --> 00:02:47.823
and I will see you in the next lecture.
