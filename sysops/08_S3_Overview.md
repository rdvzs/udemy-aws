# Chapter 8: CloudFormation for SysOps

This chapter offers a deep dive into AWS CloudFormation from a SysOps perspective, focusing on template structure, deployment strategies, and advanced features for managing infrastructure as code (IaC).

## 8.1: CloudFormation Overview
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** CloudFormation is a declarative way to model, provision, and manage your entire AWS infrastructure using code (YAML or JSON). This allows for version control, peer review, and automation.
- **Benefits:**
  - **Automation & Control:** Eliminates manual setup and ensures consistency.
  - **Productivity:** Quickly create, update, and delete entire environments (called Stacks).
  - **Cost Management:** Resources are tagged, and costs can be estimated before deployment.
- **Process:** You write a template, upload it to S3, and CloudFormation creates a **Stack** by provisioning the resources you defined in the correct order.

## 8.2: CloudFormation Template Structure
- **YAML:** The preferred format for its readability. It uses key-value pairs, indentation for nested objects, and hyphens for lists.
- **Core Sections:**
  - **`Resources` (Required):** The only mandatory section. Defines the AWS resources to be created (e.g., `AWS::EC2::Instance`, `AWS::S3::Bucket`).
  - **`Parameters`:** Defines dynamic inputs for your template, allowing for customization at deployment time (e.g., specifying an instance type).
  - **`Mappings`:** A collection of fixed key-value pairs. Useful for selecting values based on a key like the AWS Region (e.g., choosing the correct AMI ID for `us-east-1` vs. `eu-west-1`).
  - **`Outputs`:** Declares output values that you can view or import into other stacks (e.g., exporting a VPC ID).
  - **`Conditions`:** Controls whether certain resources are created or properties are assigned based on a condition (e.g., create a resource only if the environment is `prod`).

## 8.3: Intrinsic Functions (Template Helpers)
- **`!Ref`:** References the value of a parameter or the physical ID of a resource.
- **`!GetAtt`:** (Get Attribute) Fetches an attribute from a resource (e.g., `!GetAtt MyEC2Instance.PublicIp`).
- **`!FindInMap`:** Retrieves a value from a `Mappings` section.
- **`!ImportValue`:** Imports a value that has been exported from another stack's `Outputs`.
- **`!Join`:** Joins a list of values with a delimiter.
- **`!Sub`:** Substitutes variables in a string.
- **Condition Functions:** `!And`, `!Equals`, `!If`, `!Not`, `!Or`.

## 8.4: Instance Initialization (User Data & cfn-init)
- **`UserData`:** A property on an EC2 instance resource used to pass a script that runs on the instance's first boot. The script must be Base64 encoded.
- **`cfn-init` and `AWS::CloudFormation::Init`:** A more structured and powerful way to configure instances.
  - You define a configuration (packages to install, files to create, services to start) in the `Metadata` section of the EC2 resource, under `AWS::CloudFormation::Init`.
  - The `UserData` script then simply calls the `cfn-init` helper script, which reads the metadata and applies the configuration.
  - This is more readable and maintainable than a long bash script in `UserData`.
- **`cfn-signal` and `WaitCondition`:** A mechanism to signal the success or failure of an instance configuration back to CloudFormation.
  - The `UserData` script runs `cfn-init` and then uses `cfn-signal` to send the exit code (0 for success) to a `WaitCondition` resource.
  - If the `WaitCondition` does not receive the required number of success signals within a timeout period, it fails the stack creation, triggering a rollback. This ensures that a failed bootstrap process doesn't result in a "successful" but broken stack.

## 8.5: Stack Management & Policies
- **Rollbacks:**
  - **On Create Failure:** By default, if stack creation fails, all created resources are deleted (rolled back). You can disable this for troubleshooting.
  - **On Update Failure:** The stack automatically rolls back to the last known good state.
- **`DependsOn` Attribute:** Explicitly defines a creation dependency. For example, you can force an S3 bucket to be created only *after* an EC2 instance is created. CloudFormation infers most dependencies (via `!Ref`), but `DependsOn` is for explicit ordering.
- **`DeletionPolicy`:** Controls what happens to a resource when it's removed from a stack.
  - **`Delete` (Default):** The resource is deleted.
  - **`Retain`:** The resource is kept (orphaned) after the stack is deleted. Useful for protecting critical resources like databases.
  - **`Snapshot`:** For resources that support it (like EBS volumes and RDS databases), a final snapshot is taken before the resource is deleted.
- **`TerminationProtection`:** A stack-level setting that prevents the stack from being accidentally deleted.
- **Stack Policies:** A JSON document that protects stack resources from unintentional updates. When a stack policy is applied, all resources are protected by default, and you must explicitly `Allow` updates on specific resources.

## 8.6: Advanced CloudFormation Topics
- **Custom Resources:** Allows you to write custom provisioning logic in an AWS Lambda function for resources that are not natively supported by CloudFormation. A common use case is to create a custom resource that empties an S3 bucket before the bucket is deleted by CloudFormation.
- **Dynamic References:** A way to fetch values from SSM Parameter Store or AWS Secrets Manager at deployment time. This avoids hardcoding sensitive information or configuration values in your templates. The syntax is `{{resolve:service:reference-key}}`.
- **StackSets:** A powerful feature for deploying the same CloudFormation stack across multiple AWS accounts and regions in a single operation. This is ideal for setting up baseline resources, security roles, or configuration across an entire AWS Organization.
