00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.730
<v Lecturer>So in this course and in CloudFormation,</v>

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.770
I think what you will see most often

3
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.870
is going to be YAML templates.

4
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.050
And YAML is a language, as well as JSON,

5
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.990
that you can use to write CloudFormation templates.

6
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.810
I personally think that JSON is a horrible way

7
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.670
to write CloudFormation templates

8
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.300
because of many string interpolations and so on,

9
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.400
and YAML is great in so many ways,

10
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.110
especially for readability,

11
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.940
and to construct it in an easy matter.

12
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.800
So let's learn a little bit more about YAML in this lecture,

13
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.020
so you feel confident about reading these things.

14
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.750
So on the left-hand side, what I have, as you can expect,

15
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.120
is a YAML document.

16
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.500
And a YAML document is made of key value pairs.

17
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.600
And as you can see on the left-hand side,

18
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.580
the first one we have is invoice.

19
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.680
Invoice with a value, it's a number.

20
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.200
We have date, and then we have a string.

21
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.760
And then we have bill-to,

22
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.410
and within bill-to, as you can see,

23
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.650
the column has a indentation to the right,

24
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.870
and then we have multiple key value pairs.

25
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.780
So it turns out that this is what's called a nested object.

26
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.390
So we can nest objects within JSON.

27
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.450
And so the bill-to key has access to an object

28
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.250
within given, Chris,

29
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.330
family, Dumars,

30
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.830
and then address and so on is another nested object.

31
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.940
It supports array.

32
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.750
So if you look at products, there is a minus sign here,

33
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.130
which represents an array.

34
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.510
So we have multiple products.

35
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.220
So this is the first one,

36
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.810
and this is the second one.

37
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.780
And in each product we have SKU, we have a quantity,

38
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.030
we have a description, and a price.

39
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.220
And it supports multi line strings,

40
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.990
so around address lines, we have a vertical bar here,

41
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.270
which represents a multi line string.

42
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.880
And also, we can include comments.

43
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.370
They haven't been represented here, but I will show you them

44
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.440
in our own CloudFormation templates.

45
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.080
So learning how to read YAML

46
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.180
and how to make sense of it is very important,

47
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.400
and better if you can even write it.

48
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.740
But let's have a look at the CloudFormation templates

49
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.360
we have used so far.

50
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.850
So this one is a CloudFormation template.

51
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.590
The first block was resources.

52
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.590
We have a nested object within resources.

53
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.370
We had MyInstance, which had another nested object,

54
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.500
and the type was a key value.

55
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.710
So type was EC2 instance, this is a string.

56
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.440
And then properties also was a nested object

57
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.160
in which we had three key value pairs.

58
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.410
If we have a look at this one,

59
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.370
we had, again, a bunch of nested objects here too.

60
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.250
Here we have a dash,

61
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.980
so we have a list of security groups here.

62
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.630
Here's the first security group,

63
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.720
and here is the second security group.

64
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.220
We also had a hash sign here.

65
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.960
So hash is for comments,

66
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.210
so here you can have comments in YAML,

67
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.220
which is very, very nice.

68
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.240
And here is another list made of one element,

69
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.430
but still, it's a list.

70
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.370
And here is a list of two elements.

71
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.540
So as we can see,

72
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.140
YAML makes our templates very easy to read, in my opinion.

73
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.700
And once you get used to it,

74
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.700
you really unleash the power of CloudFormation.

75
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.533
So that's it.

76
00:03:06.533 --> 00:03:08.970
I hope this introduction to YAML was good for you,

77
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.223
and I will see you in the next lecture.
