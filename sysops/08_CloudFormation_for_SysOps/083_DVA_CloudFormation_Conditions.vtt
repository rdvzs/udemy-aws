00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.040
<v Instructor>So now let's talk about conditions.</v>

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.230
So conditions, as the name indicates,

3
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.410
allow you to control the creation of a resource or outputs

4
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.780
based on the specific condition.

5
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.030
So for example, you could have some things

6
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.040
only created in a development environment

7
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.390
such as the Dev Stack

8
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.538
and some things only created in the production environment

9
00:00:18.538 --> 00:00:19.830
such as the Prod Stack.

10
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.540
And as you can see, the difference here

11
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.150
is that one of these things has an EBS volume

12
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.160
and the other one doesn't.

13
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.300
So you can make conditions, whatever you want them to be.

14
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.400
But the common one is to have conditions

15
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.570
based on the environment you're in,

16
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.340
such as dev, test and prod,

17
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.880
or the region you're in, or a parameter value.

18
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.460
And each condition can reference each other

19
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.580
and can reference as well parameter values or mappings.

20
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.290
So here is an example.

21
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.970
We define a condition named CreateProdResources

22
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.700
in which we have a look at Env environment type

23
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.370
we have selected is equals to prod,

24
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.980
if it is equals to prod, then you're going

25
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.300
to have this condition being true

26
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.760
and we'll see how to use it in the next slide.

27
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.070
So to create a condition,

28
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.340
you can have any function such as And, Equals,

29
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.920
If, Not, and Or.

30
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.470
And then you have your conditions being created this way.

31
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.270
Now, how to use the condition.

32
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.770
Well here, as you can see,

33
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.200
I apply my condition to a resource,

34
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.660
but it could also be an output, et cetera, et cetera.

35
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.640
And so my MountPoint here

36
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.480
of type EC2 VolumeAttachment has a condition

37
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.250
CreateProdResources.

38
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.640
And that condition is the exact one I had defined before.

39
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.000
And so therefore, if that condition was true,

40
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.430
then the MountPoint would be created.

41
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.810
And if it was false,

42
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.420
then the MountPoint would not be created.

43
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.830
So from an exam perspective,

44
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.260
you don't need to know how to write conditions,

45
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.130
this is too advanced,

46
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.360
but you need to know

47
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.180
that conditions exist if you need to.

48
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.280
Okay, that's it, I hope you liked it

49
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.383
and I will see you in the next lecture.
