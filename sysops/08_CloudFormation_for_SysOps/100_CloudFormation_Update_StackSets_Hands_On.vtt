00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.550
<v Narrator>So welcome to the second part of Stack Set.</v>

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.770
So now we're going to add stacks into our stack set.

3
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.672
So for this, we're just going to do action

4
00:00:07.672 --> 00:00:10.019
and then add stacks to stack sets

5
00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.740
and we are able to specify more regions and more accounts.

6
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.033
So lets you specify the same account number again,

7
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.350
And we're good to go

8
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.367
As well as specifying more regions so we can have

9
00:00:23.367 --> 00:00:27.780
for example, one more region, the London region and so on.

10
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.223
Again, same deployment options.

11
00:00:29.223 --> 00:00:30.554
I'll click on next.

12
00:00:30.554 --> 00:00:33.370
If you want to override some values parameters

13
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.600
you could right here.

14
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.750
Click on next and then this looks good and submit.

15
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.180
So what this is going to do is

16
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.090
that this is going to do another operation

17
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.090
to create some more stack instances within our stack set.

18
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.114
So if I go to stack instances, we can see right here

19
00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:49.552
we have some information

20
00:00:49.552 --> 00:00:52.290
around that where the stacks have been deployed so far.

21
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.363
And so we were able to add a stacks in the stack sets.

22
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.250
So that it, my deployment is now current

23
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.194
and we've seen how to add stack sets,

24
00:01:02.194 --> 00:01:03.710
stacks within our stack sets.

25
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.133
I will see you in the next lecture for some drifts.
