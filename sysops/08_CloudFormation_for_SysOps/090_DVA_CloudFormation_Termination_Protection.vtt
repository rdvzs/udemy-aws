<v Instructor>So a very quick lecture,</v>

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.165
but to actually prevent accidental deletes

3
00:00:04.165 --> 00:00:05.880
of your CloudFormation stacks,

4
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.100
you must use Termination Protection.

5
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.100
I will show you right now how to enable it in the console.

6
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.630
So let me create a stack.

7
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.443
I will upload and type of file, name just EC2,

8
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.790
and then demo, next,

9
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.440
scroll down, next, and then actually upload this.

10
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.510
Okay, so this is my stack,

11
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.060
and what I'm going to do now is that I'm going

12
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.240
to edit the termination protection.

13
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.030
So as you can see right now it was deactivated,

14
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.140
but I'm going to activate this termination protection.

15
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.420
And now it was successfully changed.

16
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.130
So my stack right here, if I try

17
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.320
to delete it, it's impossible.

18
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.080
It says that termination protection is enabled in the stack,

19
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.720
and first, I must disable the termination protection

20
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.890
before deleting it.

21
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.800
So this is a safety against accidental deletes.

22
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.470
Now, if I have the necessary permissions

23
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.650
to actually edit the termination protection,

24
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.390
I can deactivate it,

25
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.410
and then from there

26
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.530
I can actually delete my CloudFormation stack.

27
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.363
And that's it.

28
00:01:08.363 --> 00:01:10.200
You've seen termination protection.

29
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.263
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
