00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.820
<v lecturer>Okay, so we are in Route 53</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.770
and we're going to be registering domains.

3
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.460
So as you can see, I have one hosted zone and one domain.

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.480
You should have none right now.

5
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.730
It's just because I've been using my accounts before.

6
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.770
But let's go and register a domain.

7
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.910
So on the left hand side,

8
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.830
click on register domains

9
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.690
and you have a new console experience.

10
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.490
If you don't have it, you can click

11
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.040
on somewhere to use the new console and I will use this

12
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.800
because this is what's going to happen moving forward.

13
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.510
So here we have a domain name.

14
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.070
This is stephanetheteacher.com.

15
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.530
It's something I have registered a while ago

16
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.910
and you will have nothing.

17
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.620
So what we need to do to get started

18
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.070
with Group 53 is to actually register our own domain.

19
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.300
So this is going to cost you money

20
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.890
and if you don't want to pay

21
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.830
say $12 a year to have a domain name,

22
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.040
just don't do this and watch this section entirely.

23
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.020
So I'm going to follow the step you would follow.

24
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.410
So register domain, and here you just enter a domain name.

25
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.410
So something that no one else has chosen before

26
00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.183
whatever you want.

27
00:00:59.183 --> 00:01:00.840
Okay? The idea is that you choose a domain name.

28
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.360
So hopefully no one has registered domain name.

29
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.350
Okay, perfect.

30
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.220
So I can buy this one for US $13 a year.

31
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.560
So I will select it and it's in my basket.

32
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.320
So I'm going to proceed to checkout.

33
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.850
So here is my domain name.

34
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.220
I can choose Duration, for example, one year

35
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.980
and I can autorenew or not autorenew.

36
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.780
So if you intend on keeping a domain,

37
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.790
please leave autorenew on.

38
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.590
If you don't want it at the end of the year,

39
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.780
click it so that it's off.

40
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.130
But of course, if you use the domain,

41
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.900
it's much better to keep autorenew on.

42
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.120
Otherwise someone will be able to buy the domain

43
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.170
when you lose it.

44
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.380
And this is not good, so up to you to keep it on or off.

45
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.210
But if you just intended to have it

46
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.880
for the course, then leave it off.

47
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.740
Okay, click on Next.

48
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.240
Then we have contact information.

49
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.479
So this is the information that you have part

50
00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.600
of the account that has been pre-populated.

51
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.930
And so you can enter your own information if you wanted to.

52
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.460
And so the admin contact

53
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.200
and the tech contact can be the same

54
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.330
as the registrant contact.

55
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.300
And finally, you should enable privacy protection

56
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.590
so that you don't receive spam.

57
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.510
And so that the real contact information,

58
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.240
your own personal address, phone number, et cetera

59
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.730
is hidden from the internet.

60
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.840
You click on Next and then you have the review page.

61
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.670
So make sure everything is correct

62
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.410
and you check the terms and condition.

63
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.040
And if you submit, just so you know, you will pay these $13.

64
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.240
So please don't do this

65
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.610
if you don't want to pay that amount of money.

66
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.800
Then your domain is going to be registered

67
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.000
after a little bit of time.

68
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.490
It can take a few minutes or a few hours

69
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.480
but you'll be good to go.

70
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.480
And to confirm everything, just go on the left hand side

71
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.200
to hosted zones and then you click on stefanetheteacher.com

72
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.540
or whatever domain name you have registered.

73
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.670
And you will have a few records

74
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.350
and you should have two records.

75
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.110
I have four because I've been using this before.

76
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.760
But you should have the NS record and the SOA record.

77
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.470
And the NS record is simply saying

78
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.110
that you should use the AWS DNS

79
00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.760
to insert DNS queries.

80
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.710
And this is Route 53.

81
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.170
So what this means that now that we have a hosted zone,

82
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.450
anytime we will insert DNS records such

83
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.920
as this one or that one

84
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.260
and I will teach you in the next lecture is how to do it.

85
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.610
Then the source of truth

86
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.490
for these DNS records will be Route 53 itself.

87
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.920
So what we're configuring in here, so that's perfect.

88
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.850
We're good to go.

89
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:18.720
We have a domain name

90
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.670
and we can get started with the hands-on.

91
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.793
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
