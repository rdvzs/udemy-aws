1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.370
<v Instructor>So now let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.800
and create our first records in Route 53.

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.910
So I'm going to go into my hosted zone,

4
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.960
and in there I'm going to create some simple records.

5
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.793
So let's have a look.

6
00:00:10.793 --> 00:00:13.660
We're going to create a record by clicking on here.

7
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.990
And in here, I can just have a record name.

8
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.720
So we want it to be test.stephanetheteacher.com.

9
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.240
But you can enter anything you want here.

10
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.730
This is how you would create your domain names.

11
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.920
Now you have to specify the record type.

12
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.150
So you can see there's a lot of record types in here,

13
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.360
but for now we'll keep it simple.

14
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.120
We'll keep it as an A record.

15
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.000
And which is to route an IPv4 address

16
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.870
into a domain name, to an IPv4 address.

17
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.530
So the answer is going to be

18
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.100
value is 1, 1, dot, 2, 2, dot, 3, 3, dot, four four.

19
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.150
Which is just a value we want to have,

20
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.760
and this is not a domain, an IP we own right now,

21
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.720
but just to show you just a random value.

22
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.690
Later on, we'll be routing to a real institute instance.

23
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.523
Okay.

24
00:00:53.523 --> 00:00:54.356
TTL is time to live.

25
00:00:54.356 --> 00:00:55.860
We'll leave it as 300 seconds right now.

26
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.220
And the routing policy will

27
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.900
routing policy will have a look at it later on as well.

28
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.690
We'll leave everything as simple routing. Okay.

29
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.740
So let's go ahead and create this record.

30
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.920
And now my record has been successfully created.

31
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.860
So the idea is that if I go to test.stephanetheteacher.com,

32
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.040
it is going to ask my host zone.

33
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.060
What is the value of that? And those isn't going to say,

34
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.083
well, the value of it is 1, 1, dot, 2, 2, dot,

35
00:01:21.083 --> 00:01:22.270
3, 3, dot, 4, 4.

36
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.960
So if you try it to do it with a web browser,

37
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.440
so if you take your browser and you open it

38
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.940
and you press enter,

39
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.850
and it's not going to show you many things,

40
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.626
because right now we don't have 11.22.33.44,

41
00:01:34.626 --> 00:01:38.110
there's probably no server that exists with that IP as well.

42
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.510
And if I try to just access this URL,

43
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.040
it doesn't work. Okay.

44
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.830
So what we know is what is going on behind the scenes.

45
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.910
And so for this, we're going to type some command lines.

46
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.240
Now you can be using your command line

47
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.550
on your windows laptop, or your Mac,

48
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.240
but because I want everyone to follow the same way as me,

49
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.823
I'm going to show you how to do it using

50
00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:57.270
the CloudTrail environments in AWS.

51
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.339
So let me open the management console,

52
00:01:59.339 --> 00:02:03.020
and then I'm going to click here to open cloud shell and

53
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.680
cloud shell is going to allow me to do some commands using

54
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.280
a standard Linux command line interface. Okay.

55
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.113
But this is fine,

56
00:02:10.113 --> 00:02:12.620
if you want to just do it with your own terminal on windows

57
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.603
or on Mac.

58
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.620
Okay. So my terminal is not ready.

59
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.730
And if you're on windows,

60
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.400
the NS lookup command is going to work. If you're on Mac,

61
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.800
the dig command is going to work as well.

62
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.630
But as you can see, these commands are not found

63
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.060
on my cloud shell.

64
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.970
So I need you to install them.

65
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.360
So I do sudo yum, and then install

66
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.450
minus Y and then bind

67
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.540
minus utils.

68
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.680
And it's going to install both VNS lookup

69
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.360
and the dig commands on my cloud shell.

70
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.160
So lets clear the screen.

71
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.190
And now let's try to do NS lookup,

72
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.940
test.stephanietheteacher.com.

73
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.410
And as you can see, I get an answer,

74
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.709
which is at test.stephanietheteacher.com,

75
00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.580
is going to 11.22.33.44,

76
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.380
which is corresponding to what is happening right here,

77
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.540
which is cool.

78
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.180
And I presented like the dig command a little bit more

79
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.700
because I'm more familiar with it,

80
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.440
but if you type dig and then the URL that you have,

81
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.820
okay.

82
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.020
And press enter,

83
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.940
you're going to see that and have the wrong commands.

84
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.980
So stefantheteacher.com,

85
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.780
so let's clear this screen and then retype the comments.

86
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.750
Okay.

87
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.950
Well here, we're going to see

88
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.500
is that we have the answer section

89
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.080
and says, test.stephanetheteacher.com is an a record,

90
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.660
and this is the value of the record. So I like it better,

91
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.400
better, because it shows you the TTL, as we'll see later on,

92
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.905
and also shows you the a record,

93
00:03:36.905 --> 00:03:39.100
the fact that isn't a record. Okay.

94
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.100
So we have created our first route 53 record,

95
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.830
and we have been able to query it using a terminal,

96
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:45.680
which is cool.

97
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.016
Obviously loading it from a webpage doesn't work right now,

98
00:03:49.016 --> 00:03:51.720
but we'll see how we can do it later on

99
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.330
when we have a real server.

100
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.380
So I hope you liked this lecture

101
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.330
and I will see you in the next lecture.
