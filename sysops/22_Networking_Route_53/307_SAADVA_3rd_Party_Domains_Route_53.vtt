00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.960
<v Stephane>So we need to make the distinction</v>

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.370
between a domain registrar and a DNS service.

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.680
So actually you can buy your domain name

4
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.060
with any kind of domain registrar you want,

5
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.930
and you're going to pay annual charges.

6
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.510
So the way we did it so far in this course

7
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.490
was to use the Amazon Registrar,

8
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.190
through the Route 53 console,

9
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.990
but it's possible for you to use any domain name registrar.

10
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.470
So for example, you can use GoDaddy,

11
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.530
you can just Google Domains, and so on.

12
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.010
And usually whenever you register a domain

13
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.300
with a domain registrar,

14
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.500
they will provide you as well with a DNS service

15
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.350
to manage your DNS records.

16
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.570
So when we created a,

17
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.420
when registered a DNS name with a host name with Amazon,

18
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.590
we had a Route 53 hosted zone to manage our DNS records.

19
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.210
But it's possible for you to choose not to use, for example,

20
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.370
AWS Route 53 as your DNS records,

21
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.140
when you have registered your domain with Amazon Registrar.

22
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.910
Or vice versa, you can, for example,

23
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.740
register your domain with GoDaddy.

24
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.710
So you're going to purchase example.com,

25
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.190
yet you're going to use Amazon Route 53

26
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.620
to manage your DNS records.

27
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.000
It's a perfectly acceptable combination.

28
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.070
So how do we do this?

29
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.270
Well, on GoDaddy you're going to register your domain,

30
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.200
and then you're going to have the name servers option,

31
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.220
and you can specify custom name servers.

32
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.550
So what do we put in there?

33
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.100
Well, first we're going to go to Amazon Route 53,

34
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.910
and we're going to create a public hosted zone,

35
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.380
for any domain we want.

36
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.130
And then in the hosted zone details,

37
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.820
we're going to find name servers on the right-hand side.

38
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.170
So these four name servers are the ones

39
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.640
we're are going to have to change on the GoDaddy websites.

40
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.187
So that's when GoDaddy answers a query,

41
00:01:34.187 --> 00:01:36.210
"Hey, which name server should I use?"

42
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.690
the name servers are going to be pointing to

43
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.600
Amazon Route 53 name servers,

44
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.260
and therefore we can use Amazon Route 53

45
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.100
to manage all the EDNS records

46
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.400
that are cleaved from that console.

47
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.410
So to summarize,

48
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.740
if you buy your domain on a third-party registrar,

49
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.560
you can still use Route 53 as your DNS service provider.

50
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.320
For this, you will create a public hosted zone in Route 53,

51
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.740
and then you will update the NS, or name server's records,

52
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.350
on the third-party website, where you bought your domain.

53
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.750
And then you're going to point them

54
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.990
to the Routes 53 name servers.

55
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.010
So, just so you know, a domain registrar looks like,

56
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.700
but is different from a DNS service,

57
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.480
even though every domain registrar

58
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.120
usually comes with some DNS features.

59
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.100
So that's it for this lecture.

60
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.933
I hope you liked it.

61
00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:23.830
And I will see you in the next lecture.
