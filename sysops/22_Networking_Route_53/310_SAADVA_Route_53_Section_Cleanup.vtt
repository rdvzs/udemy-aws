00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.040
<v Instructor>Okay, so let's clean up</v>

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.530
what we've done in the Route 53

3
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:04.860
if you wanted to avoid some costs.

4
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.050
So the domain name you've bought,

5
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.080
of course stays in your accounts,

6
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.950
and it will cost you $12 a year

7
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.854
if you wanted to renew it

8
00:00:11.854 --> 00:00:15.500
or more if you've bought a more pricey domain name

9
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.810
And the domain name itself, so the hosted zone,

10
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:18.700
if you're not using it,

11
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.620
you can delete this hosted zone

12
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.270
by first emptying all the records.

13
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.020
Otherwise it will cost you 50 cents per month

14
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.750
to keep this hosting zone alive, okay.

15
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.860
Within it, it doesn't matter if you have many records,

16
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.150
you can just leave them as is.

17
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.350
This is fine.

18
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.640
The other thing we have to delete is all our EC2 instances

19
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.320
in our different regions, as well as our ALB.

20
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.440
So we had EC2 instances in three different regions.

21
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.730
So what I'm going to do is just delete them one by one.

22
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.550
So there was one from me in Frankfurt,

23
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.540
and I believe that the load balancer I had created

24
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.373
is also here.

25
00:00:49.373 --> 00:00:51.780
So let me delete this load balancer as well.

26
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.670
And we can also delete the associated target group

27
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.840
with that load balancer, okay.

28
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.760
This is good.

29
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.460
And we have to perform the same kind of cleanup

30
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.293
in other regions.

31
00:01:02.293 --> 00:01:05.410
So for me was us-east-1 where I'm going to go ahead

32
00:01:06.448 --> 00:01:08.450
and delete another, terminate another EC2 instance,

33
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.100
and finally do the exact same thing in ap-southeast-1.

34
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.933
Okay.

35
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:14.566
After this, you should not incur any costs

36
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.295
out of this lectures.

37
00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:19.260
Okay, so I really hope you liked this section

38
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.110
and I will see you

39
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.110
in the next lecture.
