00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.070
<v Instructor>So now let's talk</v>

2
00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:02.830
about how we can integrate CloudWatch Events

3
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.480
or EventBridge with Lambda.

4
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.770
So two ways, number one is

5
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.410
to do a serverless CRON or a rate.

6
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.360
So we're going to create an EventBridge Rule,

7
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.110
and then every, for example, one hour

8
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.200
it's going to trigger our Lambda function to perform a task.

9
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.650
Or we can create a CodePipeline EventBridge Rule,

10
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.030
for example to detect every time CodePipeline State Changes,

11
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.730
and on State Changes is going to invoke

12
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.600
our Lambda function to perform a task.

13
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.100
Very simple idea, but let's see how

14
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.550
we can do it in the hands-on.
