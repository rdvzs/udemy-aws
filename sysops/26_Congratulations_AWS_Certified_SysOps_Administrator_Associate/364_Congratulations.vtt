<v ->Hi, this is Stephane Maarek</v>

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.250
and I wanna say congratulations for finishing the course.

3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.750
I really hope you liked it,

4
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.660
and I hope you will pass the exam without a hitch.

5
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.660
If you haven't done so, I would love a review from you.

6
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.660
Review help future students make the right decision,

7
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.780
and they help me get my course a little bit more visibility.

8
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.660
So if you liked it, I would love a nice comment from you.

9
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.430
This would really help me.

10
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.040
If you don't know how to leave a review, it's super simple.

11
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.900
A popup will show up at the end of this course

12
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.190
and will ask you for a star rating,

13
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.050
five being the highest rating.

14
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.090
You can optionally leave a comment

15
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.660
and then you can optionally answer a few questions.

16
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.120
And when you're ready, just save and exit.

17
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.130
If you don't see the popup appearing next,

18
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.840
you can click on the top right corner

19
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.960
of the course dashboard on udemy.com to add, edit,

20
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.630
or delete a rating, and you'll have the same prompt.

21
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.640
When you're ready, just save and exit.

22
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.560
Also, if you've passed the exam,

23
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.060
I'll be more than happy to know.

24
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.450
So post about it in the Q and A to motivate other students

25
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.910
or post about it on LinkedIn with your certificate

26
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.300
and tag me and I will do my best to quickly comment

27
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.560
and congratulate you as well,

28
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.840
because this is quite an achievement.

29
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.360
Overall, I hope you get a lot out of this course,

30
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.040
and I hope that your understanding

31
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.230
of AWS has vastly improved.

32
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.290
To me, that is the most important thing.

33
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.050
And if you want to practice some more in the next lecture,

34
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.130
called the bonus lecture,

35
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.490
you will find links to my extra practice exams as well

36
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.730
as my other courses with discount links included.

37
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.563
That's it.

38
00:01:27.563 --> 00:01:28.890
So I hope you like my course,

39
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.993
and I will see you in the next course.
