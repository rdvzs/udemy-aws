00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.230
<v Presenter>So, congratulations,</v>

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.930
you are about to attempt an AWS certification,

3
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.060
but there is so much more on your journey.

4
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.970
So AWS is made of foundational certifications,

5
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.740
associate level certifications,

6
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.120
professional level certifications,

7
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.390
as well as specialty level certifications.

8
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.000
And based on the type of role you want to have,

9
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.160
they recommend different paths.

10
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.070
So all these paths can be found in a document on the URL

11
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.560
that have linked below in the bottom-right corner.

12
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.940
So we have the architecture path.

13
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.130
So if you wanna become a solutions architect,

14
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.570
for example, to design, develop,

15
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.760
and manage cloud infrastructure and assets,

16
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.320
you need to do these certifications.

17
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.170
So if you already know about the cloud and in IT,

18
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.430
no need to do Cloud Practitioner,

19
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.020
but I still think it's a good one.

20
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.780
And then if you want to leverage AI, they recommend

21
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.630
the AI Practitioner Foundational Certification.

22
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.850
Then you move on to Solution Architecture Associate,

23
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.560
Solutions Architect Professional.

24
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.060
And if you want to dive deep,

25
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.060
the Security Specialty would be really recommended.

26
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.760
If you're more into application architecture,

27
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.490
so this is around the user interface, the middleware,

28
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.410
the infrastructure, and so on,

29
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.930
then they recommend to have the same as before,

30
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.330
but you add the Developer Associates

31
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.820
and then you go into DevOps Engineer Professional.

32
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.560
And then if you wanted to dive deep,

33
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.320
the Solutions Architect Professional certification.

34
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.580
So if you're into operations,

35
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.080
you can be a systems administrator

36
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.090
and your role is to install, upgrade,

37
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.400
and maintain computer components and software

38
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.650
and to integrate automation processes.

39
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.300
In which case, Cloud Practitioner

40
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.150
followed by SysOps Administrator Associate is a good one.

41
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.750
And to do a deeper dive, DevOps Engineer Professional.

42
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.030
If you're a cloud engineer and your role is to implement

43
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.030
and operate an organization network computing infrastructure

44
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.910
and implement security systems to maintain data safety,

45
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.280
then you have Cloud Practitioner Foundational,

46
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.460
SysOps Administrator Associate, Security Specialty,

47
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.860
and for a deep dive, DevOps Engineer Professional

48
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.260
and Advanced Networking Specialty.

49
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.093
If you're into DevOps,

50
00:01:50.093 --> 00:01:51.900
for example, you can be a test engineer,

51
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.960
your role is to embed testing and quality best practices

52
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.030
for software development from design to release

53
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.890
throughout the product lifecycle.

54
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.950
In which case, we have Cloud Practitioner, then Developer,

55
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.750
and then DevOps Engineer.

56
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.060
If you're a cloud DevOps engineer,

57
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.100
then your role is to design, deploy,

58
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.140
and operate large-scale global hybrid

59
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.490
cloud computing environments

60
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.790
and to advocate for end-to-end automated CI/CD pipelines.

61
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.140
So in that case, you would go

62
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.500
from Cloud Practitioner Foundational to Developer Associate

63
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.170
and then optionally, do SysOps Administrator.

64
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.540
And then if you are into machine learning,

65
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.250
then doing the Machine Learning Engineer Associate

66
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.510
could be a very good one.

67
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.950
And finally, for a deep dive,

68
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.590
the DevOps Engineer Professional Certification.

69
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.840
If you're a DevSecOps engineer,

70
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.780
so your role is to accelerate enterprise cloud adoption

71
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.920
while enabling rapid

72
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.730
and stable delivery capabilities using CI/CD principles,

73
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.680
methodology, and technology.

74
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.360
Then it is recommended for you to start

75
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.410
with Cloud Practitioner,

76
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.510
then SysOps Administrator Associates,

77
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.800
Machine Learning Associate

78
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.470
if you are working with AI and ML projects,

79
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.160
DevOps engineer, and finally, Security Specialty.

80
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.260
If you are into the security space,

81
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.330
you can be a cloud security engineer

82
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.630
and your role is to design computer security architecture

83
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.120
and develop detailed cyber security designs.

84
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.190
Then you develop, execute a new track performance

85
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.070
of your security systems to protect information.

86
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.420
So Cloud Practitioner Foundational

87
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.770
is a good one to start with.

88
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.380
If you're working with AI and ML systems,

89
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.080
AI Practitioner Foundational is also a very good one.

90
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.460
Then we have SysOps Administrator,

91
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.350
and finally, Security Specialty.

92
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.050
And for a deeper dive, DevOps Engineer Professional

93
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.770
and Advanced Networking Specialty is a good idea as well.

94
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.960
If you're a cloud security architect,

95
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.860
then your role is to design

96
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.110
and implement enterprise cloud solutions,

97
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.000
applying governance to identify, communicate,

98
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.160
and minimize business and technical risks.

99
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.140
In that case, you have Cloud Practitioner,

100
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.120
then AI Practitioner Foundational,

101
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.320
then Solution Architect Associate,

102
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.120
and then Security Specialty.

103
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.320
And you can do a deeper dive

104
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.720
on Solution Architect Professional.

105
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.580
If you're into development and networking.

106
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.080
So for development, you go

107
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.360
and you as a software development engineer,

108
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.160
you develop and you will maintain software

109
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.080
across platforms and devices,

110
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.870
so Cloud Practitioner, AI Practitioner Foundational,

111
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.330
Developer Associate and then DevOps Engineer.

112
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.490
And if you're just into networking,

113
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:06.570
then as a network engineer,

114
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.180
you need to design your LANs and your WANs,

115
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.820
so you have the Cloud Practitioner Foundational,

116
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.260
Solutions Architect Associate,

117
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.120
Advanced Networking Specialty,

118
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.970
and for a deeper dive, Security Specialty.

119
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.830
If you are in the data analytics space,

120
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.690
you can be a cloud data engineer

121
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.190
to do the automation of collection

122
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.680
and processing of structure or semi-structured data,

123
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.690
and you can monitor the data pipeline performance,

124
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.430
in which case, Cloud Practitioner,

125
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.780
then Solutions Architect Associate,

126
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.180
then Data Engineer is your way to go.

127
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.850
And for a deeper dive, you can do Security Specialty.

128
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.770
And if you're working on AI and ML project,

129
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.170
Machine Learning Engineer Associates.

130
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.850
If you are in AI or in machine learning,

131
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.290
you can be a machine learning engineer

132
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.030
and your role is to research, build,

133
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.100
and design artificial intelligence systems

134
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.140
that will automate predictive models

135
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.110
and design machine learning systems, models, and schemes.

136
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.640
So here, you can do Cloud Practitioner

137
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.640
and then AI Practitioner Foundational, Solution Associate,

138
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.770
and then Machine Learning Engineer Associate.

139
00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:59.850
And then for deeper dive,

140
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.060
Data Engineer Associate and Machine Learning Specialty.

141
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.680
Then if you're a prompt engineer,

142
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.770
your goal is to design, test, and refine text prompts

143
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.560
to optimize the performance of an AI language model.

144
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.360
So here, we're talking about Cloud Practitioner

145
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.540
and very important AI Practitioner Foundational.

146
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.490
Then we have Machine Learning Engineer Associate.

147
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.420
And then finally,

148
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.940
Machine Learning Specialty for a deep dive.

149
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.740
If you're a machine learning ops engineer,

150
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.940
you're more on the operation side,

151
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.410
so this is where you maintain

152
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.420
the platform and infrastructure.

153
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.220
So you're going to be around Cloud Practitioner,

154
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.750
AI Practitioner of course,

155
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.160
and then Solutions Architect Associate

156
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.780
and Machine Learning Associate,

157
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.710
and for a deeper dive, Data Engineer and DevOps Engineer.

158
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.380
And if you are a data scientist, your role is to develop

159
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.390
and maintain AI and machine learning models

160
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.860
to solve business problems.

161
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.450
And you train and fine tune these models

162
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.610
to evaluate their performance.

163
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:48.630
And so therefore,

164
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.610
you should do Cloud Practitioner Foundational,

165
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.440
AI Practitioner Foundational,

166
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.120
then Solution Architect Associates,

167
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.010
Machine Learning Engineer Associates,

168
00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.990
and then Machine Learning Specialty.

169
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.190
And you'll be good to go.

170
00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.720
So that's it for your learning journey

171
00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.280
on AWS certifications.

172
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.463
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
