<v Instructor>Just a short lecture</v>

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.510
around CloudFront Geo Restriction.

3
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.180
So you can restrict who can access your distribution

4
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.220
based on the country where they try

5
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.140
to access the distribution from.

6
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.900
So you can set up an allowlist to define a list

7
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.670
of approved countries,

8
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.030
or you can set up a blocklist to set up a list

9
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.920
of banned countries.

10
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.690
Now the country is determined

11
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.810
by using a third-party Geo-IP database to match the IP

12
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.570
of the user to the country it belongs to.

13
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.910
So the use case for using geo restriction

14
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.840
would be copyright laws to control access to content.

15
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.390
So to turn on geographic restrictions,

16
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.310
go under Security,

17
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.930
and then under here

18
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.810
you will find CloudFront geographic restrictions,

19
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:43.980
and there is countries.

20
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.910
And then you click on Edit.

21
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.260
So it's a bit hidden,

22
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.040
but under there you can have an allowlist or a blocklist.

23
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.810
So we can set up, for example, an allowlist

24
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.960
and let's enumerate the countries

25
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.250
that will be always allowed,

26
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.780
and the rest will be blocked by CloudFront.

27
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.110
So here we're saying that India and United States

28
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.750
is allowed on our CloudFront distribution.

29
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.330
So if we're happy with this, we save the changes.

30
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.970
And as you can see, now the type of it is allowlist

31
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.700
and the countries are listed here.

32
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.630
And that's it.

33
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.560
So I hope you liked it,

34
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.753
and I will see you in the next lecture.
