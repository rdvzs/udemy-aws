00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.520
<v Instructor>So let's go ahead and create our first VPC.</v>

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.840
Now we could launch the VPC Wizard,

3
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.400
but that would defeat the point of learning.

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.900
So what we'll have to do is create everything one-by-one.

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.130
So let's go into VPC.

6
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.170
I have one VPC available,

7
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.500
but I'm going to create a new VPC.

8
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.080
And the name tag is going to be DemoVPC.

9
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.250
Here we need to choose an iPv4 CIDR block.

10
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.150
So I will choose 10.0.0.0/16, which is allowed.

11
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.860
So, if we look at the CIDR here and calculate it,

12
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.090
that means that my First IP is this one,

13
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.670
and my Last IP is this one.

14
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.620
We have 65,000, or so, IPs in this range.

15
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.810
So, if I did /15, this would not work

16
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.448
because this would be a too big of a network, okay?

17
00:00:37.448 --> 00:00:40.430
/16 is the limit for your CIDR site.

18
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.350
So for now we are not going to assign any iPv6 CIDR block.

19
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.220
We'll see this later on in the section.

20
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.120
In terms of tenancy,

21
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.510
we have Default or Dedicated.

22
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.900
And this is to define how EC2 instances launch

23
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.550
within this VPC.

24
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.430
We'll have either dedicated hardware or shared hardware.

25
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.940
Now, dedicated hardware is very expensive.

26
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.280
So we are going to have shared hardware by default.

27
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.570
So tenancy is Default.

28
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.050
So Tags is named DemoVPC. This is good.

29
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.560
Now we'll create this VPC.

30
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.970
And my VPC is created.

31
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.170
So if we look at this VPC,

32
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.170
as we can see we have one iPv4 CIDR, zero iPv6 CIDR, okay?

33
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.190
We have already a main route table

34
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.900
and a main network ACL associated with it.

35
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.350
So some stuff was created behind the scenes,

36
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.940
when we created the VPC.

37
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:22.910
And something we should notice is

38
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.680
that we are able to add other iPv4 CIDRs.

39
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.930
So in the creates dialogue, we could only specify one,

40
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.210
But if I do Action and then Edit CIDRs,

41
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.480
and then here, I could add a new IPv4 CIDR.

42
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.480
So I could have 10.0.0, sorry, .1.0/, excuse me,

43
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.720
10.1.0.0/16, which is the next CIDR after this one.

44
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.553
And then click on Save.

45
00:01:45.553 --> 00:01:47.840
So we could have two different CIDRs in here.

46
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.580
And you could also add different IPv6 CIDRs.

47
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.710
Now to keep it very simple,

48
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.343
I'm not going to have two IPv4 CIDRs.

49
00:01:54.343 --> 00:01:55.200
I'm just going to have one.

50
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.720
But I'm going to show you that you can have

51
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.720
up to five IPv4 CIDRs within your VPC, which is quite handy.

52
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.160
Okay, so we have this DemoVPC being created.

53
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.610
This is our first step to our demo.

54
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.443
I hope you liked it.

55
00:02:06.443 --> 00:02:08.250
And I will see you in the next lecture.
