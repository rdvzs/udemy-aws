00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.610
<v ->Okay, so let's have a play with peering VPCs.</v>

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.280
So what we wanna do is to peer our 2 VPCs together.

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.550
So the demo VPC and this one I will call it the default VPC

4
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.290
which was the VPC that was created with my accounts.

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.010
So we want to peer them together, okay?

6
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.040
This is good.

7
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.120
And to do so, I'm going to prove first

8
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.350
that's the VPCs are not connected.

9
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.890
And so to do so I'm going to go

10
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.740
into my EC2 management console

11
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.180
under instances I'm going to launch an instance

12
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.320
and then I will scroll down.

13
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.400
I will scroll down.

14
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.920
Key pair will choose demo key pair, but will not need it.

15
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.810
And then we'll do network settings will launch this one

16
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.100
in a default VPC and we'll create a security group

17
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.740
launch-wizard-2 that has the SSH rule added in.

18
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.840
So that's good.

19
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.650
Let's launch that instance and we are good to go.

20
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.483
Okay.

21
00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:52.440
So now we have our BastionHost.

22
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.830
Remember that has this website available

23
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.550
and then we have this instance

24
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.550
I'll call it default VPC instance, okay?

25
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.620
And what I want to do is to connect

26
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.040
and make sure this default instance VPC can connect

27
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.530
to the instance in my BastionHost.

28
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.500
Now, if I have a look at the IPS, okay?

29
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.030
We can see that the private ipv4 is more interesting.

30
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.060
So we can have a look at probably not here.

31
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.120
So, if we look at the private ipv4 address

32
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.770
this one is 172.31.36.159.

33
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.150
And this one before was 10.0.0/72.

34
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.070
We can tell there they're in different VPC

35
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.710
because the IP addresses that are private

36
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.100
are very different.

37
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.963
So let's connect to this one, using EC2 instance connect.

38
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.713
Okay, we're connected.

39
00:01:42.713 --> 00:01:45.530
And let's also connect into my BastionHost.

40
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.783
So my instance in my other public subjects.

41
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.133
Okay.

42
00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:55.103
So if we do a curl and then we do 10.0.0.0.72:80,

43
00:01:56.901 --> 00:01:58.611
which is my IP.

44
00:01:58.611 --> 00:02:00.120
So we get a hello world.

45
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.690
So this is working fine, okay?

46
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.950
But if we do the exact same curl command

47
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.560
so we go here and we do curl on this IP, okay?

48
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.610
So this is from the 172.31 type of instance.

49
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.950
So, we're going to curl this instance right here

50
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.783
and press enter.

51
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.183
Well, this is not working.

52
00:02:16.183 --> 00:02:17.016
We get a time out.

53
00:02:17.016 --> 00:02:17.960
Well, because there is no way

54
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.360
for our EC2 instance right now

55
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.830
in this VPC to connect to the two instance in another VPC.

56
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.180
That's why it's called virtual private Cloud IaaS

57
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.970
because they're isolated from a network perspective.

58
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.760
So we're going to connect them.

59
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.780
And to do so,

60
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.150
well we need to go and create a peering connection.

61
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.130
So on the lifeline side, there is peering connections.

62
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.510
I'm going to create a peering connection

63
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.040
and I'll call it demo peering connection,

64
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.180
and we need to select a local VPC to peer with.

65
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.150
So we're going to say that the requester is my demo VPC,

66
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.060
and then we're going to select another VPC to

67
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.893
connect to.

68
00:02:50.893 --> 00:02:52.990
So it's in my accounts, but it could have another account

69
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.670
and it's in this region, but it could be another region.

70
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.890
And the acceptor of VPC is going to be the default VPC

71
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:00.970
with this CIDR.

72
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.610
So as we can see, this CIDR and that CIDR do not overlap

73
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.510
and therefore this VPC peering connection is

74
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.980
possible to create, okay.

75
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.530
So let's create this peering connection

76
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.810
and it's pending acceptance.

77
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.310
So this is not working until we have accepted it now

78
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.860
because both the VPCs are in our accounts.

79
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.310
We can accept this request ourselves, so we can accept it.

80
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.460
But if it wasn't of other accounts

81
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.880
obviously we could deny it.

82
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.060
So the requester owner ID

83
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.390
and the acceptor or ID are the same in this example.

84
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.100
So let's accept this request.

85
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.820
And now it says to send and receive traffic across

86
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.800
this VPC peering connection

87
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.060
you must adder route to the VPC period

88
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.130
in one or more of your VPC, route tables.

89
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.331
So again, this is very important, even though there's VPC

90
00:03:42.331 --> 00:03:45.010
peering connections we need to still modify the route table.

91
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.700
So again, if I try to do a curl, not from this one

92
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.150
but a curl from this instance, still not working, okay?

93
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.220
So let's go ahead and fix this.

94
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.170
So we go and modify my route tables now.

95
00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.910
And so we have one public route table,

96
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.320
and here we have I will find the right one.

97
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.670
So this is this one right here.

98
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.670
This is my default VPC default main route table,

99
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.430
main route table.

100
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.710
Okay, now we know where we are.

101
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.040
Okay, so we want to connect this and that's.

102
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.460
So let's start with a public route table

103
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.630
and I will go to routes and then edit routes

104
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.250
and I will have a destination.

105
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.380
So in this one, we need to select a CIDR, which corresponds

106
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.520
to the CIRD of my VPC that was created the default VPC.

107
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.010
So to do so let's go into your VPCs,

108
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.050
find the default VPC

109
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.640
and the IP four CIRD is right here.

110
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.520
So I'm copying it, I'm pasting it.

111
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.430
And we're saying, Hey, any traffic that is going

112
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.690
into this range of IP addresses

113
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.010
should be sent to a peering connection

114
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.270
called the demo peering connection.

115
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.780
And click on safe changes,

116
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.950
and what we've done effectively is

117
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.360
that we've created a route

118
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.630
from my creative VPC into the default VPC.

119
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.660
So if we try again though

120
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.810
and do a curl, still not working, and the reason is,

121
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.910
well we need to also modify the other route table

122
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:09.743
for it to work.

123
00:05:09.743 --> 00:05:10.576
And so let's do it.

124
00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:11.760
Let's modify the other route table.

125
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.760
So to do so, I'm going to go into the VPC main route table

126
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.330
and I will edit this route and I will add a route.

127
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.590
And this time it's for 10.0.0.0.0.0/16

128
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.440
which is now the CIRD

129
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.550
of the VPC we've created alongside this course.

130
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:30.710
And again, the peering connection.

131
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.780
And then we'll say step changes.

132
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.710
So now we have routes going both ways.

133
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.840
And so if I curl again and press enter, here we go.

134
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.860
We'll get a hello world.

135
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.140
That mean that the VPC peering connection is working

136
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.500
and it was established.

137
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.333
Okay?

138
00:05:44.333 --> 00:05:45.490
So that's it, I hope you liked it.

139
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.440
And I will see you in the next lecture.
