<v ->Okay, so now we are going to learn VPC,</v>

2
00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:03.544 line:15% 
which is the backbone of what we've

3
00:00:03.544 --> 00:00:05.280 line:15% 
been doing so far in this course,

4
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.960 line:15% 
but now we're going to formalize it.

5
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.445
So if you, in thinking of VPC,

6
00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:10.400
have a look at this diagram,

7
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.030
and if this makes sense to you,

8
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.260
if you'd say, oh, I understand everything in this diagram,

9
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.500
then you're good to go.

10
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.070
You can skip the section, right?

11
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.720
But if you don't know this diagram

12
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.845
and I would expect you not to obviously,

13
00:00:19.845 --> 00:00:21.128
don't be afraid.

14
00:00:21.128 --> 00:00:22.760
We're going to go step by step.

15
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.480
We're going to learn all these concepts.

16
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.520
We're going to build a VPC from the ground up.

17
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.500
Now, just note that in this section,

18
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.820
we're going to create a few things

19
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.070
that may cost you some money,

20
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.820
for example, a NAT gateway,

21
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.070
for example, other things.

22
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.790
And so I would suggest that you do the section all at once,

23
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.034
follow along with the hands-on,

24
00:00:39.034 --> 00:00:41.440
but then do it once in one go,

25
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.534
or maybe in two days so that you

26
00:00:42.534 --> 00:00:44.580
don't spend too much money, okay?

27
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.120
This way you can delete all the resources afterwards.

28
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.990
And finally, do not be afraid.

29
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.300
This is a lot I know but we're going to go step-by-step.

30
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.580
It took me a while to understand the VPC and to master it,

31
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.131
I've started, I think the best way possible.

32
00:00:56.131 --> 00:00:58.320
So hopefully I will get up you to speed

33
00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.780
on networking and VPC.

34
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.170
Don't worry it's going to be all fine,

35
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.690
and I hope you're super excited.

36
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.590
Now, let's get started and learn about the VPC's in depth.
