00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
<v ->So now that we've talked about NAT instances,</v>

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.330
let's look at NAT Gateways.

3
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.720
So NAT Gateways are much better.

4
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.980
There either is managed in that instances of asleep and they

5
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.200
have a higher bandwidth.

6
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.830
There is high availability you can do into it,

7
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.680
and there is no administration.

8
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.680
So you're going to pay per hour of usage and bandwidth for

9
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.630
the night gateway and the nugget weight.

10
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.150
It will be created in a specific AZ and it will inherit

11
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.140
an Elastic IP.

12
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.750
Now it cannot be used with an Institute instance within the

13
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.583
same sub-net okay.

14
00:00:26.583 --> 00:00:29.980
So the nugget weight can only be helpful if accessed from

15
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.813
another sub-net.

16
00:00:30.813 --> 00:00:33.530
So we're going to create a nugget way in a public subnets

17
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.500
and connect it to instances in the private subnets.

18
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.333
Now, the routes,

19
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.684
how it works is that it goes from the private subnets to the

20
00:00:39.684 --> 00:00:42.048
nugget way to the internet gateway. Okay.

21
00:00:42.048 --> 00:00:44.680
So net gateway can not work without an internet gateway.

22
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.380
Now the bandwidth is five gigabits per second,

23
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.570
automatically scaling up to 100 gigabits per second,

24
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.580
and you don't need to manage any security groups

25
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.610
it's not required.

26
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.970
So that means that we don't need to think about which

27
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.670
ports you enable to make the connectivity work.

28
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.260
So the way it works that right now we have this setup, okay.

29
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.090
We have a private instance and a private subnets,

30
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.830
and it can not access the internet.

31
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.430
So we're going to create the next gateway in the public

32
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.950
subnets and the nugget weight, because it is,

33
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.700
will be deployed into public subnets.

34
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.250
And the public center is already connected to the internet

35
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.180
gateway. Then,

36
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.370
then that gateway will have internet connectivity.

37
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.203
And then we can,

38
00:01:19.203 --> 00:01:22.330
we're going to edit the roots of the private subnets.

39
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.400
And by editing them,

40
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.140
we are going to be able to connect our

41
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.317
Institute instance into our nuts gateway.

42
00:01:28.317 --> 00:01:30.610
So now let's talk about high availability

43
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.860
and not gateways.

44
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.880
So the nugget weight is resilience only

45
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.850
within a single availability zone.

46
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.770
So it's going to be redundant within a single AZ,

47
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.120
but in case an AZ go down,

48
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.010
you need to have multiple net gateways

49
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.350
in multiple AZ to have fault tolerance.

50
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.390
So the way it works is like this.

51
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.760
So currently we have one gateway

52
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.810
and it's in one specific AZ,

53
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.260
we're going to create a second

54
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.110
net gateway in the second AZ so this was,

55
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.130
you can see each network traffic is confined into an AZ.

56
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.460
And so that if there is an AZ that goes down, okay,

57
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.920
this whole AZ happens to be going down.

58
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.000
Then we'll still have the ACB working

59
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.870
because a NAT gateway in ACB or X as well exists.

60
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.270
And there's no need to connect the atheist together through

61
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.570
the route tables, because well,

62
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.830
if an AZ goes down, then all the Eastern instances

63
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.283
in that are also currently unassailable.

64
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.010
So now let's just talk about the difference

65
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.420
between net gateway and other instances,

66
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.070
but there should be quite obvious.

67
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.890
So the net gateway is highly available within a specific AZ.

68
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.270
And if you want to get high voltage across AZ,

69
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.880
you need to create another one in another AZ resonant

70
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.713
instance, You wouldn't,

71
00:02:35.713 --> 00:02:38.510
have a script to manage fail-over between that instances

72
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.530
and manage them overall.

73
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.600
The bandwidth is up to 100 gigabits per second,

74
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.930
per not gateway.

75
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.090
And that for in that instance, well,

76
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.160
it depends on the instance type that you have,

77
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.590
but the higher instance type,

78
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.240
the more throughput you're going to have,

79
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.850
the maintenance is obviously a managed

80
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:52.700
service when they get way.

81
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.820
Whereas it's measured by you.

82
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.653
For instance,

83
00:02:54.653 --> 00:02:55.810
we need to make sure you have the software

84
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.380
or the U S patches and so on.

85
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.100
The cost is a per hour cost plus amount of data transfer for

86
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.738
the night gateway. Whereas for instance,

87
00:03:01.738 --> 00:03:03.910
it's per hour for these two incidents,

88
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.320
which is going to be a dependent,

89
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.640
obviously on the easy two instance type and size.

90
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.270
And also you're going to pay for network dollar that goes

91
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.700
through the ECC instance out to the internet.

92
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.533
Okay.

93
00:03:13.533 --> 00:03:14.900
Now the negative way has a public IP

94
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.240
for enterprise IP for us so this is good.

95
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.690
The same, for instance,

96
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.620
now security groups are not used for net gateway,

97
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.680
which seriously a good thing because, well, you don't,

98
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.680
you manage one more thing. Whereas from that instance,

99
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.000
you need to set up your secrets, your groups,

100
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.660
and make sure they're tight and working for the right ports.

101
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.740
And the nugget way can not be used as a bastion host.

102
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.380
Whereas in that instance could be used as a bastion host if

103
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.360
we want it to,

104
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.860
there's a lot more differences between these two things.

105
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.210
And there's a link right here,

106
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.360
but from an exempt perspective,

107
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.800
there should be enough to insert any questions into choosing

108
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.260
a NAT gateway versus in that instance.

109
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.170
So that's it for this lecture I hope you liked it.

110
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.120
And I will see you in the next lecture.
