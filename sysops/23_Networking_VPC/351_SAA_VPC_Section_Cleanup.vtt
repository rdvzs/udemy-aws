00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.700
<v ->Done a lot in this section.</v>

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.260
And we created a lot of things that can cost us

3
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.000
a lot of money if we leave them running.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.930
So, first of all,

5
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.190
for the easy two instances,

6
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.300
make sure to terminate them or to stop them.

7
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.060
I will stop them because I may need to get back to them for

8
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.030
more demos, obviously, but you,

9
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.552
I would recommend on terminating everything.

10
00:00:17.552 --> 00:00:18.710
Okay.

11
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.900
Other things that can cost you money are going to be around

12
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.940
your VBC. So let's have a look at what is created.

13
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.110
So we cannot do the PC right away.

14
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.270
We would need to delete the subnets and delete the first

15
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.510
route table. There's an internet gateway.

16
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.890
We need to detach and deletes the egress only internet

17
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.300
gateway. Again, we can delete it and detach it.

18
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.280
Elastic IPS is a very, very, very important.

19
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.060
So we did create an elastic IP that was attached.

20
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.933
Remember to our net gateway. Okay.

21
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:48.090
That gateway ID. So it's attached to it.

22
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.190
So once you delete the nugget way ID,

23
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.210
please make sure to also remove the elastic IP.

24
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.800
We did create some VPC endpoints.

25
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.960
So remember to delete these end points because they can cost

26
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.340
you money over time. They're definitely,

27
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.720
there's a per hour fee.

28
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.210
We didn't create any infant services in the end nugget way.

29
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.720
Again, we can delete it and then release the elastic IP,

30
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.047
and then any peering connection, you can delete it as well.

31
00:01:12.047 --> 00:01:14.860
Before you can remove that VBC altogether network is yells

32
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.850
again, make sure you remove the knuckles if need be,

33
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.870
but they won't cost you any money.

34
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.370
And the rest is good.

35
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.790
So please make sure to delete and clean everything up.

36
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.220
Otherwise you may have a funky surprising in the end of the

37
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.380
month. And again,

38
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.590
the best way for you to really look at your bill in AWS is

39
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.060
to go to your billing dashboard, look at the bill.

40
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.310
So as you can see how there's some bill from me over the

41
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.900
virtual private cloud. Okay.

42
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.720
And so to just address that bill,

43
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.940
when they need to do is go to bills, go to my month.

44
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.010
And then in here I'm able to see, Hey,

45
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.304
there is elastic compute cloud has been working and cost me

46
00:01:51.304 --> 00:01:52.430
one point 25.

47
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.890
So the net gateway is actually going to cost me,

48
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.080
cost me $1 and 25 already.

49
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.180
So it's good to know.

50
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.390
And then if I scroll down a route with you,

51
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.900
three did cost me 70. Of course.

52
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.200
So again, I forgot,

53
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.920
but going to route with the three and delete that hosted

54
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.180
zone. This is costing you 50 cents per month.

55
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.670
Do you have the hosted zone?

56
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.340
And then for your VPC, let's have a look at what costs.

57
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.440
So the VPC reach ability analyzer did cost me some money as

58
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.530
well. Okay.

59
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.200
So that's it for this lecture. I hope you liked it.

60
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.150
And I will see you in the next lecture.
