00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.170
<v Instructor>Okay, so the next step is</v>

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.260
to add subnets into our VPC.

3
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.580
So we're going to create two subnets.

4
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:05.950
One will be a public subnet,

5
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.920
and one will be a private subnet.

6
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.540
Now this is going to be within the one availability zone,

7
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.190
and we'll see what makes a subnet public

8
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.180
or a subnet private.

9
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.610
So let's have a look just first at what subnets are.

10
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.760
So a subnet is going to be, again,

11
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.110
a sub-range of IPv4 addresses within your VPC.

12
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.000
And it turns out that's in this range,

13
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.370
AWS will reserved the five IP addresses in it.

14
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.520
So, the first four IP addresses and the last one is reserved

15
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.740
in each subnet.

16
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.880
These IP addresses are not available for use,

17
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.020
and they cannot be assigned as an IP to an EC2 instance.

18
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.853
So for example,

19
00:00:37.853 --> 00:00:41.320
if you have a CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24,

20
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.700
then you're going to have a few reserved IP addresses.

21
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.890
Such as, well, the first one,

22
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.090
which is network address,

23
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.923
the second one,

24
00:00:46.923 --> 00:00:49.840
so .1, which is reserved AWS for the VPC router,

25
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.440
the .2, which is reserved by AWS for mapping

26
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.820
to Amazon provided DNS,

27
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.397
and this is very important,

28
00:00:55.397 --> 00:00:56.660
.3, which is not used yet,

29
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.870
but is reserved for future use.

30
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.090
And we have .255, which is a network broadcast address.

31
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.950
But because AWS does not support broadcast in a VPC,

32
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.670
this address is reserved and cannot be used, okay?

33
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.760
So as an Exam Tip,

34
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.140
if you need 29 IG IP addresses in a sub-net

35
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.820
for EC2 instances,

36
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.650
then you can not choose a subnet of /27

37
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.490
because this is 32 IP addresses, right, in this /27.

38
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.640
But if you remove the five that are reserved IP addresses,

39
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.280
you're going to get 27 addresses,

40
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.630
which are less than the number 29 that we need.

41
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.210
So we need to choose a subnet size of /26

42
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.630
because this gives us 64 IP addresses in that subnet.

43
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.250
And then if you remove the five reserved IP addresses

44
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.620
with sub-59 IP addresses,

45
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.760
which is greater than the 29 we needed, okay?

46
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.130
So, I will see you in the next lecture

47
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.530
to create our first subnets.
