00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.620
<v Instructor>So let's go ahead with creating</v>

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.020
our first VPC in AWS.

3
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.090
So VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud.

4
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.010
And you can have multiple VPC within a single AWS region.

5
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.770
You could have a maximum of five per region,

6
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.350
but this is a soft limit, so you can increase it.

7
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.680
And the number of CIDRs assigned per VPC is five.

8
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.540
Now for each CIDR, the minimum size is /28,

9
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.320
so that means at least 16 IP addresses.

10
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.020
The maximum size is /16, which is at max

11
00:00:27.242 --> 00:00:29.750
65,536 IP addresses.

12
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.860
And because VPC is a private resource,

13
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.000
only Private IPv4 ranges are allowed.

14
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.030
So again, as a reminder, we have this range,

15
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.370
that range, and that range.

16
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.970
Now how do we choose the range for our VPC

17
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.180
in terms of what types of VP are we going to assign to it?

18
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.740
Well, the general rule is that you can assign

19
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.710
whatever you want, but you should make sure

20
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.200
that your VPC CIDR does not overlap

21
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.220
with your other VPCs or other networks

22
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.130
or corporate networks, and the reason we do so

23
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.950
is that if you want to connect them together,

24
00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.340
we want to make sure the IP addresses

25
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.060
of one VPC or one CIDR do not overlap

26
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.060
with the range of IP addresses of other networks.

27
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.370
So at the end of this hands-on,

28
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.360
we're just going to have within a region a simple VPC.

29
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.410
So let's get started.
