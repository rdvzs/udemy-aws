00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.143
<v Instructor>Okay, so now let's talk</v>

2
00:00:01.143 --> 00:00:03.100
about site-to-site VPN.

3
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.880
So the idea is that, now we have a VPC

4
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.150
but we may have also a structure

5
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.710
within the corporate data center,

6
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.790
and we wanna connect AWS to our corporate data center

7
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.722
using a private connection.

8
00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:15.237
So for this, we'll have a customer gateway

9
00:00:15.237 --> 00:00:17.590
on the corporation side,

10
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.340
and a VPN gateway on the VPC side.

11
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.410
And we're going to establish,

12
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.538
through the public internet,

13
00:00:23.538 --> 00:00:27.180
a private site-to-site VPN connection.

14
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.010
So it's a VPN connection, so it's encrypted.

15
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.000
It goes over the public internet, though.

16
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.130
And using this, we have linked effectively

17
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.910
the network of our VBC

18
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.470
to the network of our corporate data center.

19
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.880
So, as such, the VPNs need two things.

20
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.980
First, they need a virtual private gateway, VGW.

21
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.560
It's a VPN concentrator on the AWS side

22
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.050
of the VPN connection,

23
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.840
and the VGW is created and attached to the VPC

24
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.860
from which you want to create

25
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.710
the site-to-site VPN connection.

26
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.810
It's possible for you to customize the ASN number,

27
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.280
if you know what that means.

28
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.530
The customer gateway is a CGW,

29
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.300
and it's an actual software

30
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.080
or a physical device on your side,

31
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.350
so on the data center side of the VPN connection,

32
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.494
And there's a bunch of these

33
00:01:07.494 --> 00:01:09.480
that will have been tested by AWS,

34
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.600
so we can have a look at the list here.

35
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.240
So, to do a connection, it's very simple.

36
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.850
We have a corporate data center with a customer gateway,

37
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.810
and then we have our VPC with our virtual private gateway.

38
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.280
So, how do we set up the customer gateway device

39
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.570
that is on premises?

40
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.670
Which IP address should we use?

41
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.000
Well, if your customer gateway is public,

42
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.310
there is a public internet-routable IP address

43
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.670
for your customer gateway device.

44
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.380
Then you would use this one,

45
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.080
and you would establish the connectivity

46
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.490
between your VGW and your CGW

47
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.960
using the public IP of the customer gateway.

48
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.640
But it's possible for your customer gateway

49
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.970
to also be private and have a private IP.

50
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.060
In which case, then it is very common for it

51
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.200
to be behind a NAT device that has NAT-T enabled.

52
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.520
And then, that NAT device has a public IP, in which case,

53
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.410
the IP address you should use for the CGW

54
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.730
is the public IP of the NAT device.

55
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.710
And then, the site-to-site VPN connection

56
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.730
can be established.

57
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.970
I'm saying this because this can come into the exam.

58
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.670
And then, the second question that can come up

59
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.503
to the exam is that,

60
00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:09.960
even though this is set up,

61
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.320
this site-to-site VPN connection will not work

62
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.200
until you enable route propagation in your VPC

63
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.160
within your subnets.

64
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.470
And then, when this is done,

65
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.410
then the connectivity will work.

66
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.170
Finally, another exam question that can come up

67
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.890
regarding site-to-site VPN.

68
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.600
If you need to ping your EC2 instances

69
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.460
from on-premises to AWS,

70
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.840
then make sure that the ICMP protocol on the inbound

71
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.210
of the security group is enabled.

72
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.800
Otherwise, I would say the connection will not work.

73
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.170
This is just a security group question, obviously.

74
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.640
But they mix it up with the site-to-site VPN

75
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.690
and that can be confusing, so here is some help.

76
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.980
Now, there's one last thing to know

77
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.230
about a site-to-site VPN.

78
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.700
It's called AWS VPN CloudHub.

79
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.440
So the idea is that you have your VPC with your VGW

80
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.080
and you have multiple customer networks,

81
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.540
multiple data centers, each with their own customer gateway.

82
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.740
So CloudHub is to provide secure communication

83
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.770
in between all these sites, using multiple VPN connections.

84
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.910
It's a low-cost hub-and-spoke model

85
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.040
for primary or secondary network connectivity

86
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.180
between different locations,

87
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.290
but only using the VPN.

88
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.420
So you would establish a site-to-site VPN

89
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.420
between the CGW and the one single VGW within your VPC.

90
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.180
And then, thanks to this connection,

91
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.250
then your customer networks can now communicate

92
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.340
with one another through that VPN connection.

93
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.280
Now, because it's a VPN connection,

94
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.360
all the traffic goes over the public internet.

95
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.683
So they're not connected through a private network.

96
00:03:37.683 --> 00:03:39.050
They're connected through public network

97
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.700
but the VPN connection is encrypted, obviously.

98
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.590
And to set it up, super simple,

99
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.330
you set up multiple site-to-site VPN connection

100
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.510
on the same virtual private gateway,

101
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.110
and then you enable dynamic routing

102
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.750
and you configure your route tables, and you're good to go.

103
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.608
So that's it.

104
00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:55.380
That's all you need to know for site-to-site VPN.

105
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.253
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
