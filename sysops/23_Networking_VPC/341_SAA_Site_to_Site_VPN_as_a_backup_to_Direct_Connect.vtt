<v Instructor>Hi, so a very short lecture</v>

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.680
on an architecture that can come up in the exam.

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.860
So the idea is that you have your corporate data center

4
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.100
and it's connected to your VPC using Direct Connect.

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.140
And that's your primary connection

6
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.750
and it's expensive, but maybe sometimes

7
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.570
you will have an issue with your Direct Connect connection,

8
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.880
and of course, you do not want to have

9
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.330
no internet connection into your VPC.

10
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.850
Therefore, you can use a Direct Connect

11
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.950
as a secondary connection,

12
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.990
but that would be quite expensive.

13
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.050
Or you can set up a site to site VPN connection

14
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.460
as a backup connection

15
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.850
and set it up so that if the primary connection fails,

16
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.550
then it kicks in, and now you are connected

17
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.880
through the public internet using site to site VPN,

18
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.100
which can be a bit more reliable

19
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.230
because the internet, public internet,

20
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.360
may always be accessible, okay?

21
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.850
So this is an architecture that can come up in the exam

22
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.380
and I just wanted to show it to you once,

23
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.030
so that you know what to expect.

24
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.650
Okay, that's it, I hope you liked it,

25
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.600
and I will see you in the next lecture.
