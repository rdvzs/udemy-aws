00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.033
<v Instructor>Now let's talk</v>

2
00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:03.600
about the VPC Reachability Analyzer.

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.840
So it's a really cool feature

4
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.520
because it's a network diagnostics tool

5
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.670
that helps you troubleshoot network connectivity

6
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.860
between two end points in your VPC.

7
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.610
So instead of having to dig through

8
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.670
the network configuration

9
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.770
and understand where the error is happening,

10
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.870
this builds a model of network configuration

11
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.460
between these two end points,

12
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.331
and then it will build and check the reachability

13
00:00:22.331 --> 00:00:25.460
based on the configuration within your AWS accounts.

14
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.960
It doesn't not actually send back it

15
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.920
from source to destination.

16
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.750
It just analyzes your configuration

17
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.290
and tell you what's happening, which is very, very powerful.

18
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.980
So if we take an example of two EC2 instances, okay,

19
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.710
it says A and B.

20
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.961
They may be in different VPCs,

21
00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:40.200
they have different ENIs

22
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.350
and they may have different security groups, okay?

23
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.532
And we're trying to figure out whether or not

24
00:00:43.532 --> 00:00:46.570
Instance A can talk to Instance B.

25
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.770
So there's a bunch of things that need to happen, okay?

26
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.500
So first it goes from the Instance A to the ENI

27
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.140
then to the security group,

28
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.140
then to the network SCLs maybe,

29
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.210
and then to the security group

30
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.447
and through the ENI to Instance B,

31
00:00:58.447 --> 00:01:00.043
and so all along the way,

32
00:01:00.043 --> 00:01:03.120
this Network Reachability Analyzer Tool

33
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.390
from the VPC function is going to check

34
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.270
whether every single point is configured properly.

35
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.670
And in which case it will say, yes,

36
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.400
these two can communicate, they are reachable,

37
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.460
but in case they're not reachable,

38
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.560
for example, because of security group issue,

39
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.730
then it will automatically detect that one security group

40
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.330
will not allow traffic in.

41
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.100
And therefore your Instance B will not be reachable

42
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.130
from Instance A but all of this is done

43
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.100
by just analyzing network configuration,

44
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.900
not by sending packets.

45
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.200
So this is the idea,

46
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.350
and this is why it's super cool,

47
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.440
because he will tell you exactly.

48
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.460
Hey, your route table right here

49
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.440
is just not properly configured.

50
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.250
So the use cases for this is to do a troubleshooting of

51
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.160
connectivity issues and to ensure the network configuration

52
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.030
is made as intended.

53
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.020
So that's it for this lecture,

54
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.853
I hope you liked it.

55
00:01:44.853 --> 00:01:46.770
And I will see you in the next lecture.
