00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.610
<v ->So now let's talk about how we can expose services</v>

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.710
in our VPC to other VPCs.

3
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.850
So option number one is to make it public.

4
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.840
And in which case, the traffic of internet,

5
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.620
we go through the public internet

6
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.260
and it's tough to manage access.

7
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.093
So here's an example.

8
00:00:13.093 --> 00:00:15.460
We have a service VPC with an application service

9
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.760
and customer VPC with internet gateways

10
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.200
and through the public internet,

11
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.500
they can communicate.

12
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.400
So this works, but it is not very optimal.

13
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.233
It's not reliable

14
00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:25.320
because it goes through the public internet.

15
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.000
I mean, there's definitely some better options.

16
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.833
Option number two,

17
00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:30.940
you may think of based on what you've seen in this section

18
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.610
is to use VPC peering.

19
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.520
And in this case,

20
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.920
in case you need to

21
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.270
have one VPC connected to multiple customers VPCs

22
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.000
you need to set up if you're hearing connections

23
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.010
between all these VPCs together

24
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.160
and that's a lot.

25
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.993
And on top of it,

26
00:00:44.993 --> 00:00:47.110
when you set up a VPC incorrect peer in connection,

27
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.580
you open up the whole network

28
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.080
of one VPC to another

29
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.560
Whereas all you wanted was just to

30
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.920
externalize one application service.

31
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.080
So as you can expect,

32
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.400
there is a better way of doing it.

33
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.090
And this way is called AWS PrivateLink

34
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.630
which is what powers the VPC endpoints.

35
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.220
And this one is also called the VPC endpoint services.

36
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.320
So it's a more secure and scalable way

37
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.920
to expose the service, say to thousands of VPC,

38
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.950
either in your own or other accounts.

39
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.872
And this is what the exam will test you on.

40
00:01:13.872 --> 00:01:15.320
You want to expose the service to thousands of VPC?

41
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.590
What do you use, all the answer is PrivateLink.

42
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.560
So it does not require a VPC peering

43
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.830
or internet gateway,

44
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.900
or knots or route tables. You know,

45
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.360
it's actually kind of magical.

46
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.180
So the way it works is that you have a service VPC.

47
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.130
If your application service

48
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.220
and a customer of VPC with a consumer application

49
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.540
now to expose your service,

50
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.860
you need to have a network load balancer

51
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.810
and an ENI or a gateway load balancer,

52
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.870
but networks of balancer there are most common.

53
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.830
So this network load balancer is going to expose

54
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.610
our application service. Okay?

55
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.330
And on the customer VPC side,

56
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.270
we're going to create an ENI.

57
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.310
And this ENI through PrivateLink is going to be connected

58
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.190
to your network load balancer.

59
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.060
And this is going to go all through

60
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.630
the private network of AWS.

61
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.540
And this is the power of PrivateLink.

62
00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.640
So in this example,

63
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.950
to establish a connection between

64
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.210
the NLB and the ENI

65
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.040
there was no need to establish VPC peering before.

66
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.960
And that's really, really, really powerful as a concept.

67
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.190
So if the NLB is in multiple availability zones,

68
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.010
then you need also ENIs in multiple availability zones

69
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.950
and you have a fault tolerance solution

70
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:17.990
on top of that.

71
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.930
So highly secure,

72
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.140
highly scalable

73
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.510
doesn't require much setup

74
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.730
and really is a good way

75
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.900
to have a filter and solution.

76
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.560
So PrivateLink is an awesome solution.

77
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.500
So a way you could set us up, for example,

78
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.150
just to show you how everything can be used

79
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.760
is for using PrivateLink with ECS.

80
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.860
So we have an ECS service with multiple tasks.

81
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.470
They're exposed to an application about an answer, okay,

82
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.270
but we know that we need a network load balancer

83
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.470
to expose this. So how do we do it?

84
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.160
Well, we connect a network load balancer

85
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.730
to the application load balancer,

86
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.970
because the ALB can now be a targets of the NLB.

87
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.150
The PrivateLink can be established directly into your NLB.

88
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.520
And so for other VPCs

89
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.110
it could be an ENI directly into PrivateLink.

90
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.340
And for your corporate data center,

91
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.240
it could be a private connection, for example,

92
00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.700
going over direct connect

93
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.520
or a VPN connection. Okay.

94
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.460
So that's it for PrivateLink. I hope you liked it.

95
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.410
And I will see you in the next lecture.
