00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.790
<v Narrator>Okay so now we're going to see how we can get</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.240
internet access into our subnets

3
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.840
because right now we don't know what a Public Subnet is

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.680
and what a Private Subnet is, and currently,

5
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.030
both our subnets do not have internet access.

6
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.380
So an Internet Gateway will allow resources

7
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.330
in a VPC to connect to the internet,

8
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.564
and it could be EC2 instances allowing the functions

9
00:00:17.564 --> 00:00:18.397
and so on.

10
00:00:18.397 --> 00:00:19.580
It will scale horizontally

11
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.610
and it's highly available and redundant.

12
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.570
So it's a really nice managed resource

13
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.550
and it must be created separately from a VPC.

14
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.310
Now one VPC can only be attached to one Internet Gateway

15
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.270
and vice versa and Internet Gateways on their own

16
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.110
do not allow internet access.

17
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.860
We must also edit the Route Tables to make it work.

18
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.880
So we'll see this in a second.

19
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.740
So currently we have a VPC.

20
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.470
We have two subnets in one EC,

21
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.270
so I didn't represent the other two subnets

22
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.560
to make this diagram as simple as possible.

23
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.200
We're going to create an Internet Gateway in this VPC,

24
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.250
and this enough will not give internet access

25
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.300
to our subnets.

26
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.930
What we need to do is to also edit the Route Tables.

27
00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.450
So we'll create a Public EC2 Instance in our Public Subnet

28
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.280
and then we will have to edit a Route Table so that

29
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.500
the EC2 Instance can connect to the Router,

30
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.690
then connect to the Internet Gateway,

31
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.740
and then from the Internet Gateway connect to the internet.

32
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.220
So let's have a look at how we can do this

33
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.220
in the next lecture.
