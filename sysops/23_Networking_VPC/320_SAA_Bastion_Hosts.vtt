00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
<v ->So now let's talk about bastion hosts</v>

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.207
and the idea is that our users

3
00:00:04.207 --> 00:00:07.590
want to access an EC2 instance that is

4
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.271
in a private subnet, but we as users,

5
00:00:10.271 --> 00:00:13.740
we are on our computer on the public internet.

6
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.960
So obviously because our EC2 instance

7
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.190
is in a private subnet

8
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.980
we don't have direct internet access to it.

9
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.556
So the trick, or one trick at least,

10
00:00:21.556 --> 00:00:23.516
is to use a bastion host.

11
00:00:23.516 --> 00:00:26.580
The bastion host is an EC2 instance,

12
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.800
that's named bastion host, okay?

13
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.080
And that EC2 instance is special

14
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.540
because it is in a public subnet.

15
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.730
It has its own security group called

16
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.830
the bastion host security group,

17
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.260
then we also have a security group, of course,

18
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.190
for our EC2 instance in the private subnet.

19
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.620
Now, the idea is that the EC2 instance

20
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.458
in the public subnet, our bastion host,

21
00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:52.620
does have access to the EC2 instance in our private subnet,

22
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.453
well, because everything is in our VPC.

23
00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:58.453
So now to access our EC2 instance in the private subnet,

24
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.140
what we do is that we first connect

25
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.780
through SSH to the bastion host

26
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.542
and then connect from the bastion host,

27
00:01:05.542 --> 00:01:10.542
again with SSH, to the EC2 instance in the private subnet.

28
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.300
And it could be one

29
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.240
but it could be as well, many EC2 instances.

30
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.598
So to summarize a bastion host is a way for us

31
00:01:17.598 --> 00:01:21.030
to SSH into our private EC2 instances.

32
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.123
And we must put the bastion host in the public subnet.

33
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.090
So in terms of security group rules,

34
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.890
this is something that can come up with the exam,

35
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.320
we need to understand what we can define.

36
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.660
So for a bastion host perspective,

37
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.054
the security group must allow access

38
00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:38.520
from the internet, okay?

39
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.070
But instead of allowing everywhere

40
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.240
from the internet access,

41
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.640
because that could be a security risk,

42
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.440
we can only restrict, for example,

43
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.700
access from the public CIDR of your corporation

44
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.800
or your internet access and so on.

45
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.060
So that we have to restrict the EC2 security group

46
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.790
of the bastion host as much as possible to guarantee

47
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.610
that only a few select IPs can access it,

48
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.912
because if somehow a random attacker has access

49
00:02:05.912 --> 00:02:08.910
to our EC2 instance as the bastion host,

50
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.750
it could be a security risk for our infrastructure.

51
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.150
Now, in terms of the security group

52
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.030
of the EC2 instances in the private subnets,

53
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.730
well, they must allow the SSH access,

54
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.140
so on the port 22 again, from this time the private IP

55
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.973
of the bastion host

56
00:02:25.973 --> 00:02:28.350
or the security group of the bastion host,

57
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.370
this is equivalent.

58
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.873
And this is because the traffic

59
00:02:30.873 --> 00:02:34.590
these EC2 instances are seeing are originating

60
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.362
from this bastion host.

61
00:02:36.362 --> 00:02:37.830
So that's it for this lecture,

62
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:38.970
I hope you liked it

63
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.920
and I will see you in the next lecture.
