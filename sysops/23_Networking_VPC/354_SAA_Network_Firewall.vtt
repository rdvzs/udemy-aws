1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.920
<v Instructor>So let's summarize the kind</v>

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.690
of ways you can protect your network

3
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.210
on AWS that we know about so far.

4
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.880
So we've seen Network Access Control Lists,

5
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.730
we've seen Amazon VPC security groups,

6
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.010
we've seen AWS WAF.

7
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.680
It protect against malicious requests made through HTP

8
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.900
on specific services that we have.

9
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.270
We've seen AWS Shield and Shield Advance

10
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.890
to protect against DDoS,

11
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.110
and we've seen AWS Firewall Manager

12
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.950
to manage them all, your rules for WAF and Shield and so on,

13
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.170
across multiple accounts.

14
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.730
Okay, so we know about this,

15
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.060
but what if we want to protect our entire VPC

16
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.040
in a sophisticated way?

17
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.850
Introducing the AWS Network Firewall.

18
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.120
So this is used to protect your entire VPC with a firewall.

19
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.620
So here's my VPC

20
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.230
and the firewall is going to be all around it.

21
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.200
And so this AWS Network Firewall protects it

22
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.320
from the layer 3 to the layer 7 protection.

23
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.800
So you can inspect any kind of traffic in any direction.

24
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.770
So you can expect VPC to VPC traffic,

25
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.620
outbound to internet, inbound from internet,

26
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.360
and to and from Direct Connect

27
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.310
and Site-to-Site VPN connections.

28
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.420
So every representative there,

29
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.580
so here we protect anything coming

30
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.020
in and out of the internet,

31
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.940
in and out of a peered VPC

32
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.620
and in and out of Direct Connect

33
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.170
or a Site-to-Site VPN connection.

34
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.546
So we define rules

35
00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:23.220
and then we can control anything that happens.

36
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.370
So internally, the network firewall uses

37
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.560
the AWS Gateway Load Balancer,

38
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.130
but instead of us setting up a third party appliance

39
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.420
to inspect the traffic,

40
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.380
we just have AWS manage it with its own appliances.

41
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.210
And so therefore, we have our own rules

42
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.770
on the firewall.

43
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.530
And these rules can be centrally managed as well

44
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.380
across multiple accounts and many VPCs

45
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.980
on the AWS Firewall Manager service.

46
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.180
So with the network firewall,

47
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.410
we have fine grained controls

48
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.800
over all kind of network traffic.

49
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.800
So we support thousands of rules at our VPC level.

50
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.080
We can filter by IP and by port

51
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.090
with tens of thousands of IPs.

52
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.860
We can filter by protocol.

53
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.470
For example, we can disable the SMB protocol

54
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.120
for outbound communication.

55
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.490
We can filter at the domain level.

56
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.160
So we say, hey, you only allow outbound traffic

57
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.490
from our VPC into our mycorp domain

58
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.470
or any third party software repository

59
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.030
that we only allow.

60
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.700
We can do general pattern matching with regex and so on.

61
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.830
And we can choose to allow,

62
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.140
drop or get alerted on the traffic

63
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.388
that will match the rules that we've set up.

64
00:02:30.388 --> 00:02:33.270
And we also have active flow inspection,

65
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.440
so we can actually have an intrusion prevention capability

66
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.480
just like we have with the Gateway Load Balancer,

67
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.940
but all managed by AWS.

68
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.400
And all the rule matches can also be sent

69
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.530
to Amazon S3, CloudWatch Logs,

70
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.560
and Kinesis Data Firehose for analysis.

71
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.360
So that's it for the network firewall.

72
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.580
This is a firewall that you do at the VPC level.

73
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.540
Remember this.

74
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.660
And you can do traffic filtering and flow inspection.

75
00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.620
I hope you liked it

76
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.570
and I will see you in the next lecture.
