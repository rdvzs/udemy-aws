00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.040
<v Instructor>So let's go on the left hand side</v>

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.340
under endpoint services to create a private link

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.210
for one of our services.

4
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.980
So if we do so, we have to name it

5
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.350
which was a log-end user type.

6
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.960
So, you will choose network

7
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.660
and then you will need to specify a network load balancer

8
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.470
in here that you have created from before.

9
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.890
So once the NLB is created,

10
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.310
then you can specify additional settings for your endpoint

11
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.870
whether or not you want acceptance.

12
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.160
And then the supported IP you want for that private link.

13
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.950
IPv4 or IPv6.

14
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:28.920
So we can't do this right now

15
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.840
but we would have here an endpoint service connected

16
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.120
to our network balancer.

17
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.731
And then to link it to your VPC, you would go on Endpoint.

18
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:41.040
You would create an endpoint.

19
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.710
And this time, instead of choosing AWS services as the type

20
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.800
of the endpoint, you would use a other endpoint services

21
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.330
and you would type the service name

22
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.800
you would've obtained from the previous step.

23
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.360
Then you would deploy this in the VPC.

24
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.700
For example, the demo VPC and voila.

25
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.070
You would have a private connection from one service

26
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.730
in another VPC to your own VPC privately

27
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.800
without either going to the public internet, okay?

28
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.370
That's it for this lecture, very theoretical

29
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.760
but I wanted to show you the options.

30
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.760
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
