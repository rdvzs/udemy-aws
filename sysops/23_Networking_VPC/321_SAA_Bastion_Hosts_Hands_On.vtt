1
00:00:00.348 --> 00:00:03.111
<v ->So it turns out that this EC2 instance we've created</v>

2
00:00:03.111 --> 00:00:06.481
in our public subnet could have a name and the name

3
00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:08.994
could be Bashian host.

4
00:00:08.994 --> 00:00:10.510
This is because we are able to SSH

5
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.000
into this fashion host and

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.780
from it, we'll be able to connect to an EC two instance

7
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.260
in a private subnet.

8
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.691
So to do so well, let's go ahead and create an EC two

9
00:00:19.691 --> 00:00:22.180
instance in a private subnet, but first, if you don't

10
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.910
have a key pair, yet sometimes I reuse accounts

11
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.090
or create new ones or transfusions.

12
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.810
So I don't necessarily have key pairs.

13
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.190
You can just enter a key pair.

14
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.410
So I'll have a, a demo key pair right here, and then

15
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.952
in the PM format.

16
00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:37.750
And then I will create my key pair.

17
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.220
So I will save this file and this is going to be very handy

18
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.960
for us to SSH into the EC two instance in my private subnet.

19
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.010
So let's have a look at how we can do it.

20
00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:49.124
So now let's go into EC two instances

21
00:00:49.124 --> 00:00:52.070
<v ->And I'm going to launch an EC two instance.</v>

22
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.380
I will scroll down Amazon Linux 2, two micro.

23
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.950
We will use the key pair named demo key pair we

24
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.590
just created.

25
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.410
And then for network settings, we will make sure to

26
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.051
launch this into our demo VPC.

27
00:01:05.051 --> 00:01:07.300
And so far as subnet association.

28
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.290
So we want to be into a private subnet, for example

29
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.020
the private subnet a, and we're going to create

30
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.393
a security group.

31
00:01:16.811 --> 00:01:19.470
I'm going to name it private SG because it is

32
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.131
a private security group and we are going to allow SSH

33
00:01:23.131 --> 00:01:26.530
but actually not from anywhere from custom

34
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.870
and this time it will choose a security group we

35
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.200
have created from before, which is called a launch

36
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.880
wizard one, which is not a great name.

37
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.960
I'm going to rename it very, very soon

38
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.960
but what it means that we allow SSH from the Bashian host.

39
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.590
And this is how through a hub,

40
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.650
through the Basian host, we're going to be able to SSH

41
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.750
into this private instance.

42
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.740
Okay, so this looks good.

43
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.393
Now let's go ahead and actually launch that instance,

44
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.640
and we are good to go.

45
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.640
<v ->So here we have our private instance and because it is</v>

46
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.440
in a private sublet, as you know,

47
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.550
we cannot use the EC two instance connect

48
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.240
into it because that will not work.

49
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.940
Okay. We will need to edit the root tables at

50
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.400
the internet gateway, but that would make the subnet public.

51
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.090
So what we have to do is to SSH

52
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.960
through the Bashian host.

53
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.890
Okay. So let's go ahead and see how we can do it.

54
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.470
So we're going to connect into our Bashian host.

55
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.670
So I will click on connect and then EC two instance connect.

56
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.319
So effectively what we're doing is that we're

57
00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.290
doing SSH into our Bashian host.

58
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.421
So you could use either EC two instance connect, or

59
00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:37.010
you know, your SSH command line through your terminal.

60
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.780
And from this fashion host

61
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.270
we wanna connect into our private instance.

62
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.103
Now our private instance

63
00:02:42.103 --> 00:02:44.840
as we can see has a private IP four address.

64
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.673
So this is what we need to do.

65
00:02:45.673 --> 00:02:49.640
So we need to do SSH easy two user at, and then

66
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.460
the private IP, and then we need to specify a key pair.

67
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.810
Okay. So yes, and this is not going to work

68
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.270
because we haven't specified a key pair.

69
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.050
So we need to actually create that key pair

70
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.130
and then have it on my EC two instance.

71
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.130
So what I'm doing is I'm going to have a VI or nano

72
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.100
and then I'll call it demo key pair.pm

73
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.490
and then I will have to paste the content

74
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.170
of the key pair I just downloaded.

75
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.270
So I open my file that PM with a text editor

76
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.821
and then I paste exactly what I have in here,

77
00:03:20.821 --> 00:03:22.930
and I wanna make sure this is going to be good.

78
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.180
So I think it's missing a new line right here.

79
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.780
Okay. This looks good, actually.

80
00:03:28.632 --> 00:03:29.731
Let's see.

81
00:03:29.731 --> 00:03:31.632
And then exit and then save.

82
00:03:31.632 --> 00:03:32.800
Okay. So let's clear the screen.

83
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.460
Let's just make sure that this has been properly saved.

84
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.890
So this hopefully looks good.

85
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:37.723
Let's see.

86
00:03:37.723 --> 00:03:38.790
I'm not too...I'm not a bit confused

87
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.590
by the formatting, but let's see.

88
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.100
And we need to make sure we change the permission.

89
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.350
So I will change the permissions on this demo key profile.

90
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.090
Okay. And now let's do this SSH command

91
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.211
and minus I demo key pair.pm, and there's a pass rise

92
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:58.790
and this is definitely an issue

93
00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.180
with the formatting of my files.

94
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.780
So what I'm going to do is

95
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.530
that I'm going to remove demo key pair.

96
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:04.930
Yes. Please remove it.

97
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.200
And I will use another text editor to see if that works.

98
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.970
So VI demo, key pair that PM.

99
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.370
And I'm gonna keep this on video

100
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.330
because this is a super important to see what can go wrong.

101
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.600
And in case you have these issues, then at least, you know

102
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.370
so this looks a lot better.

103
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.030
And then I will save this file.

104
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.030
Okay. So now if we run the SSH command again, okay.

105
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.360
This is unprotected so

106
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.590
that we are needing to running the shma command.

107
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.020
So here we go.

108
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.100
And then with such again, and here we go.

109
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.933
This has worked.

110
00:04:34.933 --> 00:04:38.360
So now we are SSH'd into my Amazon index

111
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.650
two AMI in my private subnet.

112
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.440
So this is really good.

113
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.810
We went from the Bashian host into the private instance

114
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.880
and this works, and this is quite cool.

115
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.550
But now if we try to ping Google account

116
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.970
as you can see, well, this doesn't work.

117
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.890
The private EC two instance does not

118
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.832
have internet access outgoing.

119
00:04:54.832 --> 00:04:56.740
And so we're going to see how to resolve this

120
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.573
in the next lecture.

121
00:04:57.573 --> 00:04:59.390
But so far we've seen how to use Bashian host.

122
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.223
So awesome.

123
00:05:00.223 --> 00:05:02.110
And I will see you in the next lecture.
