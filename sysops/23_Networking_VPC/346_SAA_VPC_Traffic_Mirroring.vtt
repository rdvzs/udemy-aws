00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.870
<v Instructor>So here is a very cool security feature</v>

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.120
called the VPC, Traffic Mirroring.

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.810
The idea is that we want to capture

4
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.280
and inspect network traffic in our VPC,

5
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.160
but to do it in a non-intrusive manner.

6
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.540
So to do so, we want to route the traffic

7
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.940
to security appliances that we manage.

8
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.700
And to do so, we're going to capture the traffic,

9
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.920
so we're going to define

10
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.610
which are the source ENIs

11
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.590
we want to capture the traffic from.

12
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.570
And then the targets,

13
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.280
so where do we want to send that traffic to,

14
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.980
our own ENIs or maybe a Network Load Balancer.

15
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.813
So to do an example.

16
00:00:30.813 --> 00:00:32.840
So we have an EC2 instance

17
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.610
and we have an Elastic Network Interface,

18
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.210
so an ENI attached to it

19
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.280
and works really well.

20
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.380
Our EC2 instance is accessing the internet

21
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.450
and is being accessed.

22
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.100
And so we get a lot of inbound and outbound traffic

23
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.310
on the ENI to the EC2 instance.

24
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.910
But we wanted to analyze our traffic.

25
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.720
So to do so we're going to set up a Load Balancer

26
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.870
and behind this Network Load Balancer,

27
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.650
we're going to have an auto scaling group of EC2 instances

28
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.210
that will have some security software on it.

29
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.110
Now we want to be able to capture

30
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.500
all the traffic from Source A

31
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.030
without disrupting the functioning of Source A.

32
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.080
So to do so, we're going to set up a VPC traffic mirroring,

33
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.010
and optionally, we can have a filter,

34
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.010
if you want you to get just some information,

35
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.270
not everything.

36
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.804
And with this traffic mirroring feature,

37
00:01:14.804 --> 00:01:18.210
all the traffic sent to the ENI or Source A

38
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.030
is also going to be sent to our Network Load Balancer.

39
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.310
So our Source A,

40
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.430
our EC2 instance is still working fine.

41
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.290
It still doesn't know what's happening,

42
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.290
but on top of it,

43
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.710
the traffic is being mirrored.

44
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.520
So hence the name, Traffic Mirroring,

45
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.080
into our Network Load Balancer.

46
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.750
And from there, we can analyze the traffic itself.

47
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.150
And this applies not just to one source,

48
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.180
but to multiple sources.

49
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.250
So if you had a second EC2 instance with another ENI,

50
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.380
yet again, we can mirror the traffic

51
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.590
into our Network Load Balancer.

52
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.460
So how does that work?

53
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.040
We need to have the source

54
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.450
and the targets to be in the same VPC,

55
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.907
or it could be across different VPC,

56
00:01:50.907 --> 00:01:53.730
and if we have enabled VPC Peering.

57
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.430
So the use cases for VPC traffic mirroring

58
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.550
is going to be around content inspection,

59
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.830
threat monitoring, or troubleshooting

60
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.960
from a networking perspective, okay.

61
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.490
It's very hard to demonstrate this in a demo,

62
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.150
but this diagram should be enough.

63
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.200
So hope you liked it.

64
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.150
And I will see you in the next lecture.
