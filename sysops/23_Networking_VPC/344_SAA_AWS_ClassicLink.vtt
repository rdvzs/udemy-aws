00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.430
<v Instructor>So this is just a lecture</v>

2
00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.440
about something called EC2-Classic and ClassicLink.

3
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.720
Both these things are deprecated by AWS

4
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.430
and if you see them in your exam,

5
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.100
it's most likely going to be a distractor,

6
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.600
but I just want to give you some background

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.780
so you understand what it is

8
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.840
and you don't think that course is incomplete.

9
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.730
So EC2-Classic is when you run your instances

10
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.700
in a single network shared with other customers,

11
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.650
and this is how AWS started.

12
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.080
So you could run (slurring words) instances

13
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.920
and they would be shared with your other customers

14
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.160
in terms of networking.

15
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.620
And then AWS came up with Amazon VPC,

16
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.000
where your instances now run logically isolated

17
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.440
in your AWS account.

18
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.290
So that makes a lot of sense,

19
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.350
we know about VPC,

20
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.030
and EC2-Classic is not even something

21
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.700
we can launch instances in right now

22
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.100
because it's jut not available.

23
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.250
And so when we wanted to have a link

24
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.550
between your VPC and your EC2-Classic instances,

25
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.030
you would need to create a Classic link.

26
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.390
So for this you must associate a security group,

27
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.080
and then that enables your instances

28
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.440
to communicate privately

29
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.120
from EC2-Classic to your VPC instances

30
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.900
using IPv4 private addresses.

31
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.810
And so before you had to use public IPv4,

32
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.060
but thanks to ClassicLink,

33
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.670
you can use the private network.

34
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.430
So don't try to go too deep into this.

35
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.840
These questions are likely to be distractors

36
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.673
at the exam.

37
00:01:10.673 --> 00:01:13.020
Please tell me if you don't think that's the case.

38
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.060
But just what wanted to tell you

39
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.410
what was EC2-Classic and ClassicLink.

40
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.370
There will be no hands-on,

41
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.430
just a very short, informative lecture.

42
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.263
All right, that's it.

43
00:01:20.263 --> 00:01:21.840
I will see you in the next lecture.
