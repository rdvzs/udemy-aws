00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.480
<v Instructor>So I am in my VPC</v>

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.010
and on the left-hand side of Egress Only Internet Gateways.

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.560
Now I can create one,

4
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.563
and I'll call it DemoEIGW.

5
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.740
And then we need to attach it to your VPC.

6
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.780
So my DemoVPC.

7
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.000
And then create this egress only internet gateway.

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.340
So it's created and attached already.

9
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.480
So this is good.

10
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.980
But now just to make it work,

11
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.450
well, we need to go ahead and edit a route table.

12
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.850
So let's go in here.

13
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.400
It needs to be for the private sub-net, okay?

14
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.830
It doesn't make sense for the public subnets.

15
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.490
So for the private subnets.

16
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.710
Let's go and edit the route table for the private subnets,

17
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.230
and edit these routes.

18
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.080
And we're going to say that's..

19
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.150
Yeah, You know what?

20
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.280
Anything that is going to be ::/0.

21
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.690
So any IPv6,

22
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.640
please be redirected to the egress only internet gateway.

23
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.940
Save the changes.

24
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.370
And now, all good.

25
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.100
My easy two instances in my private subnets can access

26
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.350
the internet over IPv6 but are not reachable.

27
00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.500
Super easy demo,

28
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.480
but I hope you liked it.

29
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.430
And I will see you in the next lecture.
