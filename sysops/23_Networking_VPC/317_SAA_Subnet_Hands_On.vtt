1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.260
<v Instructor>So let's go ahead and create our subnets.</v>

2
00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.050
So on the left hand side, I will go to Subnets,

3
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.610
and as we can see, there are three subnets

4
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.960
and they belong to the previous VPC.

5
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.373
So what I can do is I can filter my views by a specific VPC.

6
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.600
So I need to refresh this page first,

7
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.180
so it will click on Select a VPC,

8
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.890
and I will choose the DemoVPC

9
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.590
just to filter all my views by VPC

10
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.910
and not have any noise in my UI.

11
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.100
Okay, so now, as you can see,

12
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.900
we have zero subnets associated with that specific VPC.

13
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.810
So we'll create a subnet, and then we just select a VPC,

14
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.780
so this DemoVPC subnet.

15
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.460
And then, we need to specify the subnet settings.

16
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.550
So, the subnet name.

17
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.710
The first one is going to be PublicSubnetA,

18
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.920
and this is because we put a subnet in AZ A.

19
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.920
So, we'll specify a specific AZ,

20
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.240
so eu-central-1a, so AZ number A.

21
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.450
And then, we need to select an IPv4 CIDR block.

22
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.910
So to get started, let's go with 10.0.0.0/24.

23
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.960
This is because, in a public subnet,

24
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.130
you wanna choose not too many IP addresses.

25
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.230
Usually, this is reserved for your load balancers

26
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.700
or your front-facing infrastructure.

27
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.870
So, a smaller subnet size is good.

28
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.700
And again, if you wanna check what this is,

29
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.120
this is 256 addresses.

30
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.550
And because we have a slash 24,

31
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.470
only the last octet can change.

32
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.640
And so therefore, it goes from .0 all the way to .255.

33
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.720
Okay, so we have this name tag, PublicSubnetA.

34
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.730
And here, we can actually add a second subnet, okay?

35
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.730
So it could be PublicSubnetB,

36
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.210
and this one is going to be an AZ eu-central-1b.

37
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.180
And, so we need to choose an IPv4 CIDR block.

38
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.663
Now, the last IP address that we had in here was .0.255,

39
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.580
so what I would choose is 10.0.1.0/24, okay?

40
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.980
And this is the next range

41
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.310
after the one we've defined right here, okay?

42
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.750
So again, you can check out what this range means

43
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.090
in this website.

44
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.250
And as you can see, the first IP is 10.0.0.1.0,

45
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.860
and the second is 10.0.1.255.

46
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.000
Perfect, so we have defined two public subnets

47
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.170
and now we're going to have some private subnets.

48
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.353
So PrivateSubnetA,

49
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.660
and we need to choose an IPv4 CIDR block.

50
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.700
Now, let's choose something

51
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.923
like 10.0.16.0/20,

52
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.900
and this is a bigger subnet size, okay?

53
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.240
And if you have a look at the range about what this is,

54
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.720
so we have 4,096 IP addresses in it.

55
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.030
So, it starts at 10.0.16.0,

56
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.830
and then it ends at 10.0.31.255.

57
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.240
Okay, so this is good.

58
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.043
And now, let's add one last subnet, so PrivateSubnetB,

59
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.310
and the AZ is going to be an eu-central-1b.

60
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.530
No, I didn't set up the AZ here,

61
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.650
so let's make sure we do.

62
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.970
Okay, perfect.

63
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.840
And, the IPv4 CIDR block

64
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.830
is going to be the next logical one,

65
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.493
so .32.0/20.

66
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.470
Okay, so we have four subnets being created.

67
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.480
I will create them four.

68
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.930
And because there's no overlapping IP addresses,

69
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.430
as we can see, the creation was successful.

70
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.710
So now, if we have a look on the right hand side,

71
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.640
we can see that there are different amount

72
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.980
of IP addresses available.

73
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.920
So, this one is 251, and this one is 4,091.

74
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.220
So again, there are five IP addresses, remember,

75
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.020
that were reserved by your subnets.

76
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.490
And this is something that you remember.

77
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.500
So what you're going to get

78
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.140
is the size of the CIDR minus five,

79
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.900
so this explains these numbers right here.

80
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.750
Also, we did define these segments across two AZ,

81
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.110
so eu-central-1a and 1b,

82
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.636
and the reason we do so is you get high availability

83
00:03:36.636 --> 00:03:38.960
if we were to put resources in it.

84
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.640
But we haven't done anything yet

85
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.320
to define what makes subnets public,

86
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.640
or what makes a subnet private.

87
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.240
Right now, they all look the same,

88
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.460
so we'll see how to do this in the future lectures.

89
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.210
For now, we're good to go in this setup.

90
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.190
So I hope you liked this lecture,

91
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.140
and I will see you in the next lecture.
