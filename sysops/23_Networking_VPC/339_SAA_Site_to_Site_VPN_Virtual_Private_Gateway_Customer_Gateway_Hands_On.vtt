00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.320
<v ->So let's have a look at how you can</v>

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.920
create a site to site VPN connection in AWS.

3
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.840
So scroll down and under VPN,

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.030
you go and click on "Customer Gateways."

5
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.800
So the first step to having a site-to-site VPN connection

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.950
is to have a customer gateway that you host on-premises.

7
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.010
So you create it on-premises.

8
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.100
You can name this AWS. Okay?

9
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.220
And then you can specify a BGP ASN

10
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.290
for your gateway device.

11
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.000
This is advanced. You don't need to know it. Okay?

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.940
You need to specify the IP address

13
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.240
of your customer gateway device external interface.

14
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.880
So how it can be reached from AWS

15
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.490
into your on-premises infrastructure.

16
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.800
And then you would specify a Certificate ARN

17
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.690
which allows AWS to connect into your VPN device

18
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.680
on-premises and establish a secure connection.

19
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.520
So this is to create a customer gateway

20
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.048
but I won't do this because I don't have

21
00:00:47.048 --> 00:00:49.880
an on-premises infrastructure to show you.

22
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.500
Next, we have a Virtual Private Gateway.

23
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.996
So you would create a Virtual Private Gateway.

24
00:00:53.996 --> 00:00:57.418
And then you would use a ASN number

25
00:00:57.418 --> 00:01:00.790
and it will be created on the side of AWS.

26
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.470
Okay? So this is now the site of AWS.

27
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.980
And then we need to connect these two things

28
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.310
and therefore we need to create

29
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.740
a site-to-site VPN connection.

30
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.270
To do so we click on "Create VPN Connection."

31
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.780
It is of type "Virtual private gateway."

32
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.080
Then you specify the virtual private gateway

33
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.830
that you would have created from before.

34
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.610
You specify the customer gateway

35
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.550
you would have created from before.

36
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.170
Then you specify a lot of options

37
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.917
that you don't need to know about

38
00:01:27.917 --> 00:01:29.280
regarding routing, regarding IPV4,

39
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.000
regarding tunneling and so on.

40
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.240
And then you would create that VPN connection.

41
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.150
All this is out of scope in terms of hands-on.

42
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.859
For the exam, all you need to know is that

43
00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:39.800
to establish a site-to-site VPN connection

44
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.080
between on-premises and AWS, you need to first

45
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.500
create a customer gateway,

46
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.700
then a virtual private gateway on AWS,

47
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.300
and then connect the two using

48
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.900
a site-to-site VPN connection.

49
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.140
Okay? So that's it. I hope you liked it.

50
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.090
And I will see you in the next lecture.
