00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.330
<v Instructor>Now let's talk about Direct Connect,</v>

2
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.300
and you may also see it as DX in the exam.

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.190
So it provides a dedicated

4
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.960
private connection from the remote network into your VPC.

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.980
So you need to set up that Direct Connect connection

6
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.520
and it is using an AWS Direct Connect location.

7
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.550
You also need to set up

8
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.890
a virtual private gateway on your VPC side

9
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.090
to make the connectivity

10
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.610
between your on-premise data center and AWS.

11
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.600
The idea is that on the same connection

12
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.120
you can access both public resources

13
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.940
such as Amazon history and private resources,

14
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.130
such as EC2 Instances using the the public VIF

15
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.870
and the private VIF.

16
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.400
So what are the use cases for Direct Connect?

17
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.360
Well, you get increased bandwidth throughputs,

18
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.290
that means that if you're working with large data sets,

19
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.160
is going to be faster

20
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.410
because it doesn't go over the public internet,

21
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.890
and also you're going to have lower cost

22
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.150
because you're using a private connection.

23
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.010
Also, if you have connectivity issues

24
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.420
using the public internet,

25
00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.390
we'll using Direct Connect

26
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.170
you get a more consistent network experience,

27
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.130
again because it is private.

28
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.530
So this is especially helpful

29
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.270
if you have applications using real time data feeds.

30
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.200
Finally, it supports hybrid environments

31
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.650
because you have connectivity

32
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.490
between your own premises data center and the cloud.

33
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.120
It supports both IPv4 four and IPv6.

34
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.350
So let's look at a diagram of Direct Connect.

35
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.540
So we have a region

36
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.530
and we want to connect it into our corporate data center.

37
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.950
So for this, we're going to commission

38
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.610
an AWS Direct Connect location,

39
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.840
their physical locations that you have to find

40
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.580
but it's all obviously on the website of AWS,

41
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.290
and there's going to be a Direct Connect endpoints,

42
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.720
and there's going to be a customer or partner router

43
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.450
that you have to rent from a customer or partner cage.

44
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.850
So you have two cages in this Direct Connect location,

45
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.540
and then on your on-premise data center,

46
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.900
you're going to set up a customer router with a firewall.

47
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.130
Now you're going to set up a private virtual interface,

48
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.080
so private VIF first to access your private resources

49
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.540
into your VPC.

50
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.360
So to do so, you set up the private VIF

51
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.240
in between all these locations

52
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.930
into a virtual private gateway.

53
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.340
And this virtual private gateway

54
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.180
is attached to your VPC.

55
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.100
And through the private VIF,

56
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.600
you are able to access your private subnets

57
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.720
with your EC2 Instances.

58
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.940
And as you can see,

59
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.770
all these things happen privately,

60
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.900
so you need to set up that connection manually,

61
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.320
it can take a month to set up,

62
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.930
but none of this goes over the public internet,

63
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.983
it is all a private connectivity.

64
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.300
The alternative is to connect to public services within AWS

65
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.410
such as Amazon Glacier, Amazon S3.

66
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.730
And for this, you're going to set up

67
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.580
a public virtual interface or public VIF.

68
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.480
And so it goes through the same path

69
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.100
but it doesn't connect into a virtual private gateway,

70
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.053
it connects directly into AWS.

71
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.070
So what if you want to connect

72
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.600
to one or more VPCs in different regions?

73
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.120
For this, you must use a Direct Connect gateway.

74
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.250
So we have an example

75
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.930
where we have two regions,

76
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.360
and they have two different VPC,

77
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.010
we have two different CIDRs

78
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.510
and we want to connect our on-premise data center

79
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.960
into both VPC.

80
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.010
So we're going to establish a Direct Connect connection,

81
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.090
then using the private VIF,

82
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.370
you're going to connect it to Direct Connect gateway.

83
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.210
And this gateway will have a private virtual interface

84
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.010
into a virtual private gateway

85
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.040
in the first region and another one in the second region.

86
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.100
So using the setup, we can start connecting to multiple VPCs

87
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.320
and multiple regions.

88
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.900
Okay, now let's discuss the connection types

89
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.340
for Direct Connects.

90
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.960
We have a dedicated connection,

91
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.961
We have a dedicated connection,

92
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:33.130
it could be 1, 10 or 100 gigabits per second capacity,

93
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.270
and we get a physical ethernet port that is dedicated to us.

94
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.000
And first we need to make a request to AWS,

95
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.080
and then it will be completed

96
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.860
by an AWS Direct Connect partner.

97
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.470
Or we can get a hosted connection,

98
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.660
and they come in different flavors

99
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.877
such has 15 megabits per second, 500 megabits per second

100
00:03:49.877 --> 00:03:50.710
up to 10 gigabits per second.

101
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.810
And again, we make connection requests

102
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.860
via via AWS Direct Connect Partners.

103
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.390
And then we can add capacity on demand,

104
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.260
so we can add or remove capacity on demand,

105
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.090
so it's a bit more flexible than a dedicated connection.

106
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.210
And so we can get one, two, five 10 gigabits available

107
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.120
at select locations.

108
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.430
And to set up either a dedicated or a hosted connection,

109
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.080
the lead times are often longer

110
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.620
than one month to establish a new connection.

111
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.630
So in the exam, they will ask you questions around,

112
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.520
hey we want you to transfer some data within a week

113
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.780
and we want it to be fast.

114
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.190
So an answer can not be Direct Connect

115
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.570
because Direct Connect takes

116
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.670
often more than one month to establish.

117
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.580
So you need to look into question

118
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.070
whether or not there's already a Direct Connect established,

119
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.600
and whether or not the time to transmit the data

120
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.560
is less or greater than one month.

121
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.530
Now, when you have a Direct Connect, there is no encryption.

122
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.300
So data is not encrypted

123
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.770
but it is private because it is a private connection.

124
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.450
And so if you want an encryption on top of it,

125
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.870
you can set up Direct Connect to be alongside a VPN

126
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.710
to provide IPsec encrypted private connection.

127
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.070
So it's good to get an extra level of security

128
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.160
but it's slightly more complex to put in place.

129
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.570
So to set up is to get the Direct Connect location,

130
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.440
but then on the connection,

131
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.290
you're going to set up a VPN connection on top of it,

132
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.430
to have encryption for your Direct Connect

133
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.680
and therefore all the traffic

134
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.290
between your corporate data sensor to AWS

135
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.683
is going to be encrypted.

136
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.390
Now, one last thing that can come up in the exam,

137
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.130
is around resiliency for Direct Connect.

138
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.630
So we have two modes of resiliency and architectures

139
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.840
and you need to know them both

140
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.520
because they will be coming up at the exam.

141
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.340
You have a high resiliency for critical workloads

142
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.590
where we set up multiple Direct Connects.

143
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.660
So we have two corporate data centers

144
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.807
and we have two different Direct Connect location,

145
00:05:37.807 --> 00:05:39.630
and this gives us some redundancy.

146
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:40.600
So in the first case,

147
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.450
we have a private VIF here and we have a private VIF here.

148
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.510
And so here we get one connection and multiple locations,

149
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.580
and so if one of the Direct Connect location goes down,

150
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.140
then at least we have some backup

151
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.110
Direct Connect location somewhere else

152
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.230
and so this gives us high resiliency,

153
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.840
and this is good for critical workloads.

154
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.780
But if you want to get to maximum resiliency

155
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.700
for critical workloads

156
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.090
and I emphasize the word maximum

157
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.770
because it can come up in the exam,

158
00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.640
then you're going to have to set up

159
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.000
again two Direct Connect locations,

160
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.130
but this time each Direct Connect location

161
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.500
will have two connections

162
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.430
independence to give you maximum resiliency.

163
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.810
So in this use case, we have four connections

164
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.260
across two locations, sorry, going into AWS.

165
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.470
And so a maximum resilience is achieved

166
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:27.910
by using separate connections,

167
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.530
terminating on separate devices in more than one location.

168
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.020
So that's it for Direct Connect.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.020
I hope you liked this lecture,

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.970
and I will see you in the next lecture.
