<v Stephane>Hello and welcome to the AWS Certified SyOps</v>

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.020
Administrator Associate Course of version SOA-C02.

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.040
My name is Stephane Maarek

4
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.856
and I will be your instructor for this course.

5
00:00:10.856 --> 00:00:12.750
So we're going to prepare for the SOA-C02 exam,

6
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.430
which is a very challenging certification,

7
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.760
I think is the most difficult of all associate exam.

8
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.790
But this course will be long and hopefully very interesting.

9
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.480
And so I definitely recommend that you do this certification

10
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.070
after having done at least

11
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.620
the Solutions Architect Associate Certification

12
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.710
or the Certified Developer Associate Certification.

13
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.870
Now this course is structured as an advanced course,

14
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.550
and so some base knowledge is going to be needed

15
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.860
for all videos and so for all sections.

16
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.600
And so videos are going to be imported

17
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.430
from different courses of mine.

18
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.810
So there will be some videos from my

19
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.760
Certified Cloud Practitioner course,

20
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.730
which will be marked with the CCP tag.

21
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.340
There will be some with, they are coming

22
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.230
from the Solutions Architect Associate course

23
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.543
and it will be marked with the SAA tag,

24
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.810
and then some from the Certified Developer Associate course

25
00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.700
marked with a DVA tag.

26
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.620
So the idea is that if you've done some

27
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.453
of my previous courses,

28
00:01:02.453 --> 00:01:04.470
you know which lectures to skip,

29
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.000
and I've included this base knowledge

30
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.310
because not everyone comes with the same path.

31
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.732
Some people will have done some courses and others not.

32
00:01:11.732 --> 00:01:12.600
So I've preferred to include

33
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.280
as much information as possible.

34
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.710
But if this is a video that you've already seen,

35
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.030
please feel free to skip it

36
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.700
or just re-watch it again to get a little refresher.

37
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.053
It never helps.

38
00:01:22.968 --> 00:01:26.407
And so for the videos are specific to this course, well,

39
00:01:26.407 --> 00:01:27.240
they will not be tagged at all.

40
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.576
They will not be marked with brackets.

41
00:01:29.576 --> 00:01:33.172
So this will be all the CSAP specific videos in this course.

42
00:01:33.172 --> 00:01:34.968
So now a little bit about me.

43
00:01:34.968 --> 00:01:35.801
So my name is Stephane Maarek

44
00:01:35.801 --> 00:01:38.392
and I will be your instructor for this course.

45
00:01:38.392 --> 00:01:41.250
I have 11 AWS certifications, so all of them,

46
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.900
and I've worked with AWS for many years.

47
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.460
I've built websites, applications,

48
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.837
streaming platforms, and so on.

49
00:01:46.837 --> 00:01:49.814
I've been teaching for almost seven years on Udemy

50
00:01:49.814 --> 00:01:51.270
about certifications or services such as

51
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.790
CloudFormation, Lambda, and EC2.

52
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.870
As you can see,

53
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.580
I have over 2 million students that went

54
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.603
through my courses,

55
00:01:58.494 --> 00:02:00.090
and everyone has been very successful with this course.

56
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.123
So I'm very happy that you're here following along with me.

57
00:02:04.264 --> 00:02:05.190
So you can connect with me on social media.

58
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.880
You can follow me on LinkedIn, on Instagram, on Medium,

59
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.943

60
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.010
I thank you very much for choosing this course

61
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.240
and choosing to learn with me.
