00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.240
<v ->Hi and welcome, my name is Stephane Maarek,</v>

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.760
and I will be your instructor for this course.

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.380
I'm delighted to have you here,

4
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.600
I really hope that you will enjoy this course

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.240
and that you will go all the way through with it.

6
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.640
So, this is just a two-minute introduction

7
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.020
so that you get to know me,

8
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.540
and then we'll hop right into the course.

9
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.450
I'm French, so if you hear a small accent,

10
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.590
this is where it comes from,

11
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.810
it's the sweet country of France.

12
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.930
But I've also lived in the United States, in Australia,

13
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.460
and now in Portugal.

14
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.420
My expertise is going to be around AWS certifications

15
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.340
and Apache Kafka.

16
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.173
Why?

17
00:00:36.173 --> 00:00:37.320
Well because in my career,

18
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.720
I've had the chance to be a data analyst,

19
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.250
a big data engineer, a developer, and a solutions architect.

20
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.850
Well, obviously nowadays I'm a teacher, I love to teach,

21
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.290
and this is my passion,

22
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.810
and I'm gonna help you achieve any goals you have

23
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.370
through online learning.

24
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.020
So before we get started with this course,

25
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.150
there are two ways you can connect with me.

26
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.980
The first place is on LinkedIn.

27
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.860
So this is where I will share some news about AWS

28
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.480
and the Kafka ecosystem.

29
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.389
This is where I announce new courses,

30
00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:08.400
and this is where I congratulate my students.

31
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.830
So, for example, if you've completed the course,

32
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.690
or you passed a certification,

33
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.760
make a post on LinkedIn and tag me,

34
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.160
and I will make sure to congratulate you.

35
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.080
I love to see my students reach their goals,

36
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.240
this is my main motivation.

37
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.400
The second way is on Instagram.

38
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.950
So, Instagram is a big part of mine

39
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.960
that I've started several years ago.

40
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.730
So I love to travel the world,

41
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.840
and I dedicate some of my time to actually meet my students.

42
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.290
And to date, I've already met over 40 students.

43
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.910
So every time I meet students,

44
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.590
we'll have a chat about your goals,

45
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.110
about how the course helped you in your career,

46
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.000
and just general chat about life.

47
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.540
And at the end of it, I will make a post on Instagram.

48
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.030
So if you want to get the chance to meet me,

49
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.700
or to read about other students' stories,

50
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.740
then follow me on Instagram.

51
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.050
Finally, before starting this course,

52
00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.880
I want you to set a goal.

53
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.960
By setting a goal,

54
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.140
you will have a much higher chance of finishing this course

55
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.120
and learning a lot.

56
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.790
So maybe you want to finish this course in three weeks,

57
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.050
that's perfect.

58
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.430
This is how you learn,

59
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.760
and this is how you will make the most out of this course.

60
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.830
And don't hesitate to go through the videos

61
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.930
as many times as needed.

62
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.210
This is what videos are used for.

63
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.750
If necessary, you can speed up the video or slow it down,

64
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.810
so it becomes easier for you to understand me.

65
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.160
So, that's it for me.

66
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.870
I hope you will enjoy the course,

67
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.030
and I will see you in the next lecture.

68
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.186
Happy learning!

69
00:02:34.186 --> 00:02:38.603
(bright music fades)
