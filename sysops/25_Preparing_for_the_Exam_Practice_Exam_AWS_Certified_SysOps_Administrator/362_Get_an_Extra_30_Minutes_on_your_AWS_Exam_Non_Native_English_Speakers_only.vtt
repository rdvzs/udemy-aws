00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.980
<v Instructor>So if you're not an English speaker,</v>

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.580
one thing you can do is actually request for more time

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.600
and request accommodation.

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.664
So on the left hand side, under exam registration,

5
00:00:09.664 --> 00:00:11.229
click on exam accommodation

6
00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:13.920
and you can request an extra 30 minutes

7
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.888
for non-native English speaker.

8
00:00:15.888 --> 00:00:20.888
So click on this and then select the ESL +30 minutes

9
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.360
and then you could add documentation if you needed to,

10
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.243
and then request the accommodation.

11
00:00:26.243 --> 00:00:29.430
Once it's done, it's approved and it doesn't expire.

12
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.454
And now you can go ahead and schedule your exam

13
00:00:32.454 --> 00:00:36.330
so if you had exam schedule before, you need to cancel them.

14
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.580
And now select schedule exam again.

15
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.670
And this time the 30 minutes accommodation will be taken

16
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.090
into account and you will have more time for your exam.

17
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.816
If you need any other accommodation,

18
00:00:46.816 --> 00:00:50.272
then you can directly request it from Pearson View exam on

19
00:00:50.272 --> 00:00:52.650
their websites, but that's the one

20
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.330
that people use the most usually as

21
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.438
a non-native English speaker like me because I'm French.

22
00:00:57.438 --> 00:01:00.174
Okay, so that's it for this lecture. I hope you liked it.

23
00:01:00.174 --> 00:01:02.220
I wish you the best of luck for your exam

24
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.443
and I will see you in the next lecture.
