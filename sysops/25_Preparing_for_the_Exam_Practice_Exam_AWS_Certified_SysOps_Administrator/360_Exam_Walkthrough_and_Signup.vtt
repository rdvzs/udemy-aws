00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.774
<v Instructor>So now is the time to sign</v>

2
00:00:01.774 --> 00:00:04.765
into your AWS Certification accounts.

3
00:00:04.765 --> 00:00:09.765
For this, you go to this URL, aws.training/certification,

4
00:00:09.787 --> 00:00:12.840
and then you click on Sign In.

5
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.841
From there, you're going to have to create

6
00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:17.752
an AWS Builder ID, which is a specific account

7
00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:20.550
for AWS certifications.

8
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.765
So you click on it, you go through the process,

9
00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:24.745
and then you'll be good to go.

10
00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:28.750
After you sign in, click on Go to Your Account,

11
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.563
and this is going to take you into the certification portal.

12
00:00:32.563 --> 00:00:34.860
And in here you have several options.

13
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.502
So in this video I'm going to show you

14
00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:40.290
how to schedule an exam, but I strongly recommend

15
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.810
as well that you watch the next two videos.

16
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.420
One is around exam accommodations to get extra time

17
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.719
if you're not a native English speaker,

18
00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.511
which can really help you during your exam.

19
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:54.482
And also, I will show you certification benefits

20
00:00:54.482 --> 00:00:58.980
on how to sometimes get 50% on your next AWS exam.

21
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.802
So please make sure to watch these videos next.

22
00:01:00.802 --> 00:01:03.300
But right now, lemme show you the exam registration.

23
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.782
So you click on Exam Registration and schedule an exam.

24
00:01:06.782 --> 00:01:11.003
And in here, we have at the bottom, the exams we can pass.

25
00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.272
So some of them are going to be authorized,

26
00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:16.485
some of them are going to be click to authorize to schedule.

27
00:01:16.485 --> 00:01:19.752
So you click on Authorize and it will just do something,

28
00:01:19.752 --> 00:01:21.303
and then schedule is available.

29
00:01:21.303 --> 00:01:22.754
So I'm not sure why you have to authorize things,

30
00:01:22.754 --> 00:01:24.472
but here it is.

31
00:01:24.472 --> 00:01:25.975
Okay, so now let's say for example,

32
00:01:25.975 --> 00:01:27.736
that we want to schedule the

33
00:01:27.736 --> 00:01:30.239
AWS Certified Developer Associate Exam.

34
00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:32.752
So click on Schedule, and this is going to take you

35
00:01:32.752 --> 00:01:36.840
into the Pearson VUE portal, which is going to be

36
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.302
the exam schedule partner of AWS.

37
00:01:40.302 --> 00:01:42.733
So in here, we have several options.

38
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:46.770
We can specify to want to take the exam

39
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.132
in person at a test center or online with OnVUE.

40
00:01:50.132 --> 00:01:52.970
So this is when you want to actually go somewhere

41
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.273
and take it in a specific room,

42
00:01:55.273 --> 00:01:57.660
because for example, you don't wanna take it from home.

43
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.767
So in that case, you need to bring your photo ID,

44
00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:01.742
you need to make sure that you understand how it works,

45
00:02:01.742 --> 00:02:05.760
and what you can and cannot bring during the test.

46
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.832
You would click on Next.

47
00:02:06.832 --> 00:02:10.754
And in the following pages, you are able to select

48
00:02:10.754 --> 00:02:13.044
the language you want to take your exam in.

49
00:02:13.044 --> 00:02:16.199
So different options based on where you're from.

50
00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:20.754
And finally, you can also select where you want to take it.

51
00:02:20.754 --> 00:02:23.788
And so for this, you're going to have to agree

52
00:02:23.788 --> 00:02:28.762
to these conditions, first of all, and then find a place.

53
00:02:28.762 --> 00:02:31.523
So you would just enter an address,

54
00:02:31.523 --> 00:02:34.532
and then you would look at different addresses

55
00:02:34.532 --> 00:02:36.775
where you can actually take your exam.

56
00:02:36.775 --> 00:02:39.559
So the alternative is to do online with OnVUE,

57
00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:41.551
and I like it because you're at home,

58
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:42.800
it's very easy to take it.

59
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.705
So you need your computer with a webcam

60
00:02:44.705 --> 00:02:46.786
and a good internet connection.

61
00:02:46.786 --> 00:02:48.475
And here it says Run system test.

62
00:02:48.475 --> 00:02:50.737
And I strongly, strongly, strongly recommend you

63
00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:52.768
to run the system test way before your exam

64
00:02:52.768 --> 00:02:54.725
so you make sure everything is good.

65
00:02:54.725 --> 00:02:57.734
Your testing space must be clear of everything.

66
00:02:57.734 --> 00:03:02.284
So you'll need put nothing on your desk, remove everything,

67
00:03:02.284 --> 00:03:04.797
and make sure that the person controlling that

68
00:03:04.797 --> 00:03:07.160
will be asking you to show your desk and so on.

69
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.709
So there are some examples here.

70
00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.660
Bring an ID, and then you need to check in

71
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.009
about 30 minutes before your appointment time

72
00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:15.719
just to make sure that you are

73
00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.840
going to be attending your exam on time.

74
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.714
Then you click on Next.

75
00:03:20.714 --> 00:03:22.742
You choose your language again.

76
00:03:22.742 --> 00:03:25.474
Then you agree to all the things

77
00:03:25.474 --> 00:03:28.080
that you need to agree about, making sure

78
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.711
you are taking this space, this exam from your home.

79
00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:35.143
Then you agree, then you choose the language you want

80
00:03:35.143 --> 00:03:37.386
the person who is going to check your desk,

81
00:03:37.386 --> 00:03:40.394
and so on, to speak, so you have these options,

82
00:03:40.394 --> 00:03:42.990
but this is different from your exam version.

83
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.640
This is just to check you in.

84
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.713
Then, what is your time zone.

85
00:03:46.713 --> 00:03:50.677
Finally, selecting a date, selecting a time,

86
00:03:50.677 --> 00:03:54.769
and then booking, and finally, completing the payments.

87
00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.723
And adding a voucher, if you have a discount voucher,

88
00:03:57.723 --> 00:04:00.783
which I will show you how to do it in the next lecture.

89
00:04:00.783 --> 00:04:01.671
So that's it.

90
00:04:01.671 --> 00:04:05.490
Now, once the exam is scheduled, to actually take it,

91
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.707
maybe it'll appear upon a coming exam,

92
00:04:07.707 --> 00:04:11.536
but the way I like to do it is to go on Home, Dashboard.

93
00:04:11.536 --> 00:04:14.065
And when you're ready, before your exam,

94
00:04:14.065 --> 00:04:16.781
you click on Manage my Pearson VUE account,

95
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:18.738
which is going to take you, again,

96
00:04:18.738 --> 00:04:20.735
to the homepage of Pearson VUE.

97
00:04:20.735 --> 00:04:25.433
And from there, you will be seeing a launch exam button,

98
00:04:25.433 --> 00:04:26.751
which is very easy to access.

99
00:04:26.751 --> 00:04:29.235
So you'll have here, the exam appearing,

100
00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:31.720
and you just click on Launch, and you're good to go.

101
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.203
All right, so that's it for this lecture.

102
00:04:33.203 --> 00:04:34.339
I hope you liked it.

103
00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:36.933
And I will see you in the next lecture.
