00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Instructor>So I want to show you a trick</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.640
in which you can actually get 50% off your AWS exam

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.340
if you have taken one before.

4
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.450
So as soon as you pass an AWS exam successfully,

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.670
you're going to get tokens, which are going

6
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.310
to give you 50% on your next exam.

7
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.640
And the ones that are unclaimed will be as unclaimed.

8
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.170
So these two are unclaimed right here,

9
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.940
and there's an expiry date.

10
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.100
And then to get the actual exam,

11
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.710
you would click on Claim Benefits.

12
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.543
Once you have claimed a benefit,

13
00:00:29.543 --> 00:00:31.440
they will appear as claimed.

14
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.510
And here you get a voucher code.

15
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.320
So this code right here, you would copy it,

16
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.520
and this will give you 50%.

17
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.390
So how to apply it, well, when you go into your cart

18
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.890
and you are about to pay,

19
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.100
so you click on Proceed to Checkout.

20
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.780
So then you have to enter the payment.

21
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.060
And here you can add a voucher promo code

22
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.560
in this box right here.

23
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.480
And this is the code that you would obtain right here.

24
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.033
So you would get the code and then apply it.

25
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.840
And now you see that I have a discount on my total cost.

26
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.800
So this is great.

27
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.020
So I hope this trick will save you a lot of money.

28
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.100
I hope you liked this lecture,

29
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.083
and I will see you in the next lecture.
