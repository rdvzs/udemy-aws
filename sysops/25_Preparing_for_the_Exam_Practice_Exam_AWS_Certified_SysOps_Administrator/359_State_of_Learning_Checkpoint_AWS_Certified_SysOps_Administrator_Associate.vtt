00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.140
<v Lecturer>So congratulations</v>

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.300
on making it this far in the course.

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.280
Now let's look at the certifications page

4
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.220
to see how far we've gone on our learning journey.

5
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.590
So here I am on the certified CSOPs Administrator

6
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.050
Associate certification page.

7
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.080
And what you can do is that you can scroll down

8
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.260
and as you can see, as of March 28th, 2023,

9
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.570
there is no exam labs until further notice.

10
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.360
So if you have seen somewhere on the internet

11
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.680
that there is an exam lab, this is not the case anymore.

12
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.050
And in case the exam labs do come back,

13
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.850
I will update this lecture

14
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.860
or you can tell me to update this lecture.

15
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.800
Okay, so let's have a look at a few things.

16
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.350
So first of all, let's look at the exam guide

17
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.120
and then in your own time you can have a look

18
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.220
at the sample questions, they're great.

19
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.090
So you have questions

20
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.210
and at the bottom of it you can have a look at the answers

21
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.660
and know why they are or they're not the correct answers.

22
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.730
Now if we look at this exam guide right here,

23
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.000
so this is for the SOA-C02 exam

24
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.220
and is going to validate your ability

25
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.180
to look at workloads from the well architected framework

26
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.000
to perform tasks using the console or the CLI,

27
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.310
to look at logs to have security controls,

28
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.580
apply networking concepts and so on.

29
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.590
So your ideal description is

30
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.690
that you should have at least one year of experience

31
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.740
with deployment management,

32
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.410
networking and security on AWS.

33
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.060
But if you have done the course,

34
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.980
you should have gained this experience,

35
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.090
especially if you practiced in the hands-on alongside me.

36
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.650
So all the knowledge

37
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.780
for general IT is taught in this course.

38
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.840
And then for the recommended risk knowledge of fully,

39
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.570
I do teach you it, but I always get feedback from the

40
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.280
students that they pass the exam

41
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.560
after working and practicing.

42
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.390
So this is perfect.

43
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.550
Just so you know, there are some tests that are scope

44
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.230
for the target candidates such as

45
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.640
distributed architectures doing CI/CD pipelines and so on.

46
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.220
So the exam content is only questions.

47
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.130
Okay, so we have multiple choice and multiple response.

48
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.230
So multiple choice, you have one correct response

49
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.910
out of four answers.

50
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.920
So three or wrong, one is correct,

51
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.740
and multiple responses that you have, two or more correct.

52
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.720
And the exam will ask you

53
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.190
how many answers should be correct.

54
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.370
So say select two or select three.

55
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.170
If you don't reply correctly to the question,

56
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.490
you are not penalized.

57
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.579
So you need to just answer all the questions.

58
00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.140
There are no more labs.

59
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.830
You have 50 scored questions and 15 unscored questions,

60
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.530
but you do not know which ones are which

61
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.070
and the exam time is 130 minutes.

62
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.370
So here, just describe the exam labs part

63
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.650
because it's not relevant for now.

64
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.080
And then the result is that you're scored out of

65
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.777
between 100 and 1,000 and the passing score is 720.

66
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.210
Now if you look at the content outline, I invite you

67
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.100
to look at each of the domains

68
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.140
and make sure that you are comfortable

69
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.700
with all these things such as monitoring, reliability,

70
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.650
you have deployments,

71
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.690
security and compliance

72
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.090
and networking and content delivery

73
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.910
and cost and performance optimization.

74
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.337
In the appendix you have the in-scope

75
00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:10.020
AWS services and features.

76
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.940
So this is a very long list

77
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.530
and if there is something

78
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.110
that I don't treat specifically in the course

79
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.020
is because I haven't heard from anyone

80
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.730
that it is actually at the exam.

81
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.240
So the exam guide is always wider than the exam itself.

82
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.550
Of course if something does appear at the exam

83
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.240
and is not dealt with in the course, please reach out to me

84
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.610
and I will make sure to create a lecture on it.

85
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.030
This is how I proceed and it's been very successful so far.

86
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.310
Still you have the in-scope services

87
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.410
and the out of scope services

88
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.750
and hopefully that should give you more confidence.

89
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.280
So I hope you liked it.

90
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.860
I hope you are going to train with the sample questions

91
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.300
and so on for your exam.

92
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.360
But so far if you've practiced alongside me in the course,

93
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.070
you should be quite ready for it.

94
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.050
Alright, that's it. I hope you liked it

95
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.123
and I will see you in the next lecture.
