00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.410
<v ->Hello, and welcome to this lecture on AWS Backup.</v>

2
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.490
So AWS Backup is a fully managed service

3
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.600
and it allows you to centrally manage

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.710
and automate backups across all

5
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.080
your AWS services.

6
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.910
And the list is getting bigger and bigger

7
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:14.880
by the day.

8
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.770
So the idea is that you want

9
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:16.603
to have a central place.

10
00:00:16.603 --> 00:00:18.660
You don't want to create any custom scripts

11
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.480
or have any manual processes.

12
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.750
You want to have a central view

13
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.000
of your backup strategy.

14
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.660
So supported services are pretty wide.

15
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.080
For example, Amazon EC2, EBS, Amazon S3, RDS and

16
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.850
all database engines supported,

17
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.090
Aurora, DynamoDB, DocumentDB, Amazon Neptune,

18
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.400
EFS, FSX, including Lustre,

19
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.450
and Windows File Server

20
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.723
and probably others.

21
00:00:41.577 --> 00:00:42.520
AWS Storage Gateway,

22
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.180
such as the Volume Gateway.

23
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.080
And it's more that can come over time, but I'm

24
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.220
not necessarily going to update

25
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.780
this lecture because, well

26
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.613
it doesn't really matter.

27
00:00:50.613 --> 00:00:52.990
The ideas that you get the concept behind

28
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.860
database backup

29
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.590
and the most important services

30
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.310
are shown on the slide.

31
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.140
So it supports cross-region backups.

32
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.660
Doesn't mean that you cant have

33
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.080
your backup pushed to another region

34
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.890
for disaster recovery strategy,

35
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:05.960
all in one place.

36
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.370
And also supports cross-account backups,

37
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.750
if you are using multiple accounts

38
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.540
in your AWS strategy.

39
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.180
So, it supports point

40
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.060
in time recovery for supported services,

41
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.360
such as Aurora.

42
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.539
It supports on-demand and scheduled backups.

43
00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:22.020
There's tag-based backup policies to

44
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.388
make sure you only backup

45
00:01:23.388 --> 00:01:25.057
maybe resources that have been tagged

46
00:01:25.057 --> 00:01:26.960
with production.

47
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.080
And you can create backup policies known

48
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.160
as Backup Plans.

49
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.880
You define the frequency, for example

50
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.980
every 12 hours or weekly or monthly

51
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.470
or whatever cron expression you have,

52
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.940
the Backup Window.

53
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.440
If you want to transition the backup

54
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.780
itself to Cold Storage.

55
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.970
So never, or maybe after some days,

56
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.870
some weeks, some months or some years,

57
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.190
and the Retention Period of your backup.

58
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.350
So every always or days, weeks, months, and years.

59
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.440
So it's quite supportive and comprehensive

60
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.460
and it supports really most services,

61
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.160
so it's a really nice addition

62
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.180
to the AWS services.

63
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.550
So if we have a look at AWS Backup,

64
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.390
we create a backup plan, as I said, and then

65
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.937
you assign specific AWS resources

66
00:02:05.937 --> 00:02:08.100
that are important to you.

67
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.680
So here is a list, but it can get bigger.

68
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.660
And then once it's done well,

69
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.830
automatically your back,

70
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.620
your data is going to be backed up to Amazon S3

71
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.830
in an internal bucket that is specific

72
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.253
to AWS Backup.

73
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.600
And another feature you need to know about

74
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.790
for AWS Backup is the Vault Lock.

75
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.550
So you enforce a WORM read, Write Once Read Many

76
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.520
Policy.

77
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.030
That means that all your backup

78
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.860
that you store in your Backup Vault

79
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.620
cannot be deleted.

80
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.470
So the idea is that, you know for sure,

81
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.230
you can prove it that thanks

82
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.760
to the Vault Lock Policy,

83
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.220
you cannot delete your backups.

84
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.450
And it provides an additional layer of defense

85
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.530
for your backups against, for example

86
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.270
inadvertent or malicious delete operations or

87
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.150
updates that shorten or alter

88
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.690
the retention period.

89
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.940
And even the root user itself cannot delete

90
00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.310
backups when enabled.

91
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.370
So it gives you strong guarantees on the safety

92
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.680
of your backups.

93
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.150
Okay, that's all you need to know

94
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.280
for the AWS Backup service.

95
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.150
I hope you liked it,

96
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.100
and I will see you in the next lecture.
