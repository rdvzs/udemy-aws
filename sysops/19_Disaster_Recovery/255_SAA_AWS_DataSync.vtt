00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.210
<v Instructor>So now, let's talk about AWS DataSync.</v>

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.680
And DataSync is a service

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.920
that is appearing now quite a lot at the exam.

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.850
It's a very simple one,

5
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.070
but you need to know what it does and its core.

6
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.450
So the idea as an image,

7
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.180
to indicate is to synchronize data.

8
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.410
Therefore, move large amount of data to, and from places.

9
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.690
And these places can be for example,

10
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.690
on-premises or other cloud locations into AWS.

11
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.610
So you would connect to your server using the NFS,

12
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.480
the SMB, the HDFS, or other protocols,

13
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.210
and it needs an agent to run on-premises

14
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.910
or on the other cloud to do that connection.

15
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.880
And you can, for example, do other types of migrations.

16
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.110
For example, you can move data from one AWS service

17
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.120
to another AWS service.

18
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.950
And this requires no agent.

19
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.240
I will show you what it means.

20
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.270
So the idea is that you can synchronize data

21
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.270
to Amazon S3 including any storage classes, even Glacier.

22
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.660
Amazon EFS, to store into your network file system,

23
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.230
or Amazon FSx, and it supports all of them.

24
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.930
Now, the replication tasks are not continuous.

25
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.340
They are scheduled,

26
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.840
so you can make DataSync run hourly, daily, or weekly.

27
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.280
So there's a lag, okay?

28
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.120
But the data is going to be synchronized on a schedule.

29
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.880
On top of it, DataSync has the ability

30
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.480
to keep the file permissions and the metadata.

31
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.880
That means the security and so on.

32
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.050
So that means that it's compliance

33
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.910
with the NFS POSIX file system and the SMB permissions.

34
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.430
This is very important because at the exam,

35
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.170
this will be the unique option

36
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.450
that will preserve the metadata of your file

37
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.600
when moving them from one location to another.

38
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.910
One DataSync agent can be quite powerful.

39
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.190
It can run one task,

40
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.520
can use up to 10 gigabits of data per second.

41
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.340
Although, if you don't want to max out your network

42
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.650
you can set up a bandwidth limits.

43
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.860
So let's have a look at what it means in the diagram.

44
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.650
So here is the use case of synchronizing

45
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.260
your on-premises files using the SMB

46
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.110
or NFS protocol into AWS.

47
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.450
And that could be S3, EFS or FSx.

48
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.870
So you have your on-premises and then your AWS region

49
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.700
where DataSync is running.

50
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.820
So here is your NFS or SMB server.

51
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.970
And what you have to do is to install on-premises

52
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.680
the AWS DataSync agent, and you will tell it to connect

53
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.140
to your NFS or SMB server.

54
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.480
And then the DataSync agent will establish a connection

55
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.910
and also connect in an encrypted fashion

56
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.860
into the DataSync service.

57
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.650
From there, you can tell it to go wherever you want.

58
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.910
That could be any storage class for your Amazon S3 buckets

59
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.910
or it could be AWS, EFS, or it could be Amazon FSx.

60
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.870
And the synchronization can happen one way

61
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.600
from on-premises to AWS,

62
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.600
but you can also synchronize from AWS back into on-premises.

63
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.620
This is why it's called DataSync.

64
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.330
It can work any way.

65
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.250
Now, sometimes at the exam

66
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.260
we will tell you that we want to use DataSync,

67
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.680
but we don't have the network capacity to do so.

68
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.390
Therefore, what you have to think about

69
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.770
is to use the AWS Snowcone device specifically

70
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.720
because the Snowcone device comes

71
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.360
with the DataSync agent pre-install on it.

72
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.090
So you can run Snowcone on-premises,

73
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.940
then it will pull your data, run the DataSync agents,

74
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.720
then it will be shipped back into your AWS region

75
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.710
and then synchronize your data

76
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.460
to the storage resources of AWS.

77
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.850
So that is to show the architecture of synchronization

78
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.990
from on-premises to AWS, or it could be for example,

79
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.350
another cloud to AWS using the DataSync agents.

80
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.900
But you can also use DataSync to just synchronize

81
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.540
between different AWS storage services.

82
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.210
For example, do you want synchronize between Amazon S3,

83
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.910
or Amazon EFS, or Amazon FSx,

84
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.230
back into Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, or Amazon FSx.

85
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.070
And for this, again,

86
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.840
we will use the AWS DataSync service

87
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.760
and it will copy the data of course,

88
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.890
but also the metadata will be kept

89
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.350
between the different AWS storage services,

90
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.340
which is very important.

91
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.830
And again, something that can come up in the exam.

92
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.640
So to remind you, DataSync can pretty much synchronize

93
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.250
between anything, but it is not continuous.

94
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.160
It is scheduled task that can be happening hourly,

95
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.960
daily, weekly, and also it will preserve metadata

96
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.600
and your file permissions.

97
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.720
And finally, you need to run the DataSync agents

98
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.560
if you are connecting to an NFS or SMB server.

99
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.300
Okay, that's it for this lecture.

100
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.300
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
