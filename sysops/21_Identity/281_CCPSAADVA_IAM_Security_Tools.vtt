<v Instructor>We are nearing the end of the section,</v>

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.650
but first let's talk about the kind of security tools

3
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.100
we have in IAM.

4
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.570
So we can create an IAM Credentials Report

5
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.740
and this is at your account-level.

6
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.670
This report will contain all your accounts users

7
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.220
and the status of their various credentials.

8
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.460
We'll be actually generating it right now

9
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.260
and having a look at it.

10
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.710
The second security tool we're gonna use in IAM

11
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.600
is called IAM Access Advisor.

12
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.690
This one is at the user-level

13
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.910
and the Access Advisor is going to show

14
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.100
the service permissions granted to a user

15
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.150
and when those services were last accessed.

16
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.850
This will be very helpful because we are talking already

17
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.320
about the principle of least privilege,

18
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.170
and so using this tool, we're able to see which permissions

19
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.460
are not used and reduce the permission a user can get

20
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.640
to be inline with the principle of least privilege.

21
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.370
So I will see you in the next lecture

22
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.393
to show you how to use the security tools.
