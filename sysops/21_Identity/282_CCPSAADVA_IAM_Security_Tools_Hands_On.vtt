00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.610
<v Instructor>So let's generate a credentials report.</v>

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.840
For this, on the left hand side,

3
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.610
I just click on Credential report

4
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.620
and then Download credential report

5
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.080
which is going to create a CSV file.

6
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.930
Now this CSV, because I'm using a training account,

7
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:13.920
is not fascinating,

8
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.530
but as we can see we have two rows in it.

9
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.800
We have my root account and my account name, stephane.

10
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.260
We can see when the user was created,

11
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.840
if the password was enabled,

12
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.020
when the password was last used and last changed,

13
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.030
when is the next rotation to be expected

14
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.460
if we do enable password rotation?

15
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.660
Is MFA active?

16
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.940
So we can see it's active from my root accounts

17
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.760
but it is not active for my Stefane accounts.

18
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.310
Then access keys, are they generated or not?

19
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.200
Yes, they're created for my Stefane account,

20
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.640
but not for my root account,

21
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.480
and when they were last rotated, last used and so on,

22
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.180
you can get more information about other access keys

23
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.890
and certificates and so on.

24
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.540
So this report is extremely helpful

25
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.460
if you want to look at some users

26
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.900
that haven't been changing the password,

27
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.490
or using it, or their account,

28
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.790
it could be giving you a great way to find which users

29
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.880
that deserve your attention from a security standpoint.

30
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.280
Now let's have a look at IAM Access Advisor.

31
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.650
For this, I'm gonna go to my user, stephane,

32
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.280
and then on the right hand side, I click on Access Advisor.

33
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.290
And Access Advisor is going to show me

34
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.890
which services were accessed by my user and when.

35
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.103
So as you can see, organizations, health,

36
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.300
identity and access managers with IAM Service,

37
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.120
EC2, Resource Explorer, were all accessed by my user.

38
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.280
So I use my user to access these things

39
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.270
by clicking in the UI, but some services were not accessed,

40
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.550
for example, Alexa for Business

41
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.070
or AWS App2Container and so on.

42
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.600
So using Access and Advisor, you can actually have a look

43
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.750
at whether or not the user has the correct permissions.

44
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.570
And it turns out that maybe based on this access,

45
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.670
have 37 pages of this,

46
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.480
maybe the user needs access only to a few services

47
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.920
but not all of them.

48
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.070
And this UI allows you to drill down.

49
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.430
On top of it, if a user accesses a specific service

50
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.560
for example Amazon EC2, we are told

51
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.780
that this is the administrator access

52
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.820
that granted access to this service.

53
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.460
So to summarize, Access Advisor becomes very helpful

54
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.750
when you need to do granular user access permissions on AWS.

55
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.040
So that's it for this lecture.

56
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.373
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
