00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.080
<v ->So now let's discuss IAM Access Analyzer,</v>

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.240
and this is a service within the IAM console that is used

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.770
to find out which resources

4
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.440
are going to be shared externally.

5
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.080
So S3 buckets, IAM Roles, KMS Keys,

6
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.100
Lambda Functions and Layers, SQS Queues

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.520
and Secrets Manager Secrets.

8
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.550
So, the idea is that some of these obviously

9
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.500
can have resource policies attached with them

10
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.550
or they can be shared with other accounts.

11
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.140
But sometimes you forget about sharing these items

12
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.540
and it can be a security risk for your company

13
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.410
because some of the app may be accessible

14
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.130
by external sources.

15
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.520
And so you define a zone of trust,

16
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.240
which is going to correspond to your alias accounts

17
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.570
or your entire alias organization,

18
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.530
and then anything outside your zone of trust that has access

19
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.300
to the resources said above

20
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.660
are going to be reported as findings.

21
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.470
So for example, we have an S3 buckets,

22
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.790
we can share it with a specific role, a user, an account,

23
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.740
an external client by IP or VPC endpoint.

24
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.350
But if we define the zone of trust to be our accounts

25
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.900
and only the role of the user and the VPC endpoints

26
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.370
are within our accounts,

27
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.440
then the accounts and the external clients

28
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.300
are going to be flagged as a finding.

29
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.480
And you can look at it within the consultant to take action

30
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.330
if you think this is a security risk.

31
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.330
So in the IAM console, on the left hand side,

32
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.390
you have access analyzer and here you can create

33
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.880
your first analyzer.

34
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.640
So you name it, console analyzer.

35
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.630
This is free by the way to enable.

36
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.600
The zone of trust

37
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.300
is going to be the current account right now.

38
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.040
And the findings are going to be reported

39
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.720
outside of your zone of trust.

40
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.290
You can add tags to the analyzer but we don't need to.

41
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.690
And then I'm going to create the analyzer.

42
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.630
This is going to create a service linked role

43
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.330
which is going to allow the analyzer

44
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.513
to interact with resources on our behalf.

45
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.823
So my scan has not completed and as you can see,

46
00:01:46.823 --> 00:01:49.520
I have three active findings right now in my accounts.

47
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.620
So one SQS queue and two S3 buckets are shared

48
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.940
with all principals.

49
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.090
So this one is shared through a bucket policy

50
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.320
and this one doesn't say how, and this is write access

51
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.620
and this is read access.

52
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.810
So it's very interesting.

53
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.140
For example, let's consider this SQS queue

54
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.998
called a demo S3 notification.

55
00:02:07.998 --> 00:02:10.090
So we can click here to have a link

56
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.650
directly into the resource and then go here

57
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.010
and then go to access policy.

58
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.810
And as you can see, I allow anyone to send a message

59
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.780
and anyone could be anyone from an external accounts.

60
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.150
So this is not good, right?

61
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.270
So what I should do then is have a look at this

62
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.720
and make sure that this is either the intended access

63
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.400
of my queue so I can archive it or a not intended access.

64
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.940
And then I go to the SQS console, I fixed this policy,

65
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.430
and then I rescan. So I'm going to edit this.

66
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.830
And I don't like this policy,

67
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.040
so I'm going to just remove this policy overall,

68
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.780
because I don't want to allow anyone

69
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.890
to send a message into my SQS queue.

70
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.093
I will click on save and now I will do a rescan.

71
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.970
And now the status is resolved

72
00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.160
because the access is no longer allowed.

73
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.670
So if I go back to my findings now only have two findings.

74
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.590
And here as well, I have two findings

75
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.900
related to my S3 buckets being public.

76
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.910
And so maybe this is an intended access

77
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.633
in which case I will archive this buckets.

78
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.960
And then If I go back to my findings,

79
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.730
it will be into the archived column.

80
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.080
We see we have the other one from the resolve column

81
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.930
and we can still look at the active ones.

82
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.620
And then finally, if you wanted to always archive

83
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.460
these kind of S3 public buckets,

84
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.700
you can go into archive rules

85
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.450
and you can create your own rule

86
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.225
to automatically say which criteria

87
00:03:35.225 --> 00:03:38.490
should make a finding irrelevance. Okay.

88
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.670
If you want it to.

89
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.240
So that's it for this lecture. I hope you liked it.

90
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.190
And I will see you in the next lecture.
