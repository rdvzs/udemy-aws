00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.190
<v Instructor>Now, here is a quick lecture</v>

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.550
around RDS and Aurora Security.

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.980
So you can encrypt the data at-rest

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.140
on your RDS and Aurora database.

5
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.710
That means that the data is encrypted on the volumes.

6
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.080
For this, you will be having the master

7
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.740
and any replica encrypted using KMS.

8
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.020
And this is defined at launch time

9
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.390
during the first launch of your database.

10
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.390
If somehow you haven't encrypted the master database,

11
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.650
the main database,

12
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.650
then the read replicas cannot be encrypted.

13
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.930
Also, if you wanted to encrypt

14
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.750
an already existing unencrypted database,

15
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.870
what you would have to do is to take a database snapshot

16
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.760
from that un-encrypted database,

17
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.190
and then you restore that database snapshot

18
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.020
as an encrypted database. Okay?

19
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.280
So you have to go through a snapshot and restore operation.

20
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.540
So this is for at-rest encryption.

21
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.890
Then you have in-flight encryption.

22
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.160
So between your clients and your database.

23
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.400
So each database on RDS and Aurora

24
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.460
is ready to have in-flight encryption by default.

25
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.350
And so therefore, your clients must

26
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.890
use the TLS root certificates from AWS.

27
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.133
They're provided on the AWS website.

28
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.760
In terms of database authentication.

29
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.350
Because this is RDS and Aurora,

30
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.100
you can use the classic combo of username and password.

31
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.960
But because it says AWS,

32
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.590
you can also use IAM roles to connect to your database.

33
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.970
That means that's, for example,

34
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.340
if you're EC2 instances had IAM roles,

35
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.980
they can authenticate to your database directly using that

36
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.900
and not a username and a password,

37
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.450
which can help you manage all the security

38
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.030
within AWS and IAM.

39
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.970
You can also control network access to your database

40
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.500
using security groups.

41
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.470
So you can allow or block specific ports,

42
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.800
specific IP, specific security groups.

43
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.970
And then finally RDS and Aurora do not have SSH access,

44
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.920
of course, because they're managed services,

45
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.920
except if you use the RDS custom service from AWS.

46
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.480
And if you wanted Audit Logs.

47
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.550
So to know what queries are being made

48
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.620
on RDS and Aurora over time

49
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.240
and what's happening on databases,

50
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.100
you can enable Audit Logs.

51
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.680
And then they will be lost after a bit of time.

52
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.390
Therefore, if you wanted to keep them

53
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.640
for a long period of time,

54
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.940
what you need to do is to send them into a dedicated service

55
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.210
called the CloudWatch Logs service on AWS.

56
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.590
So that's it for the short lecture

57
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.520
on the summary options for security, for RDS and Aurora.

58
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.450
I hope you liked it.

59
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.400
And I will see you in the next lecture.
