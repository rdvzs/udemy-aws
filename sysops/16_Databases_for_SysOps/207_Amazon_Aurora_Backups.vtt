00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.700
<v Lecturer>Now let's talk about backups, backtracking,</v>

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.300
and restores for Aurora.

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.150
So there are some automatic backups

4
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.210
and you can have a retention period between one and 35 days.

5
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.580
They can not be disabled.

6
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.400
And this allows you to do point-in-time recovery.

7
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.980
So PITR, to restore your database

8
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.450
within five minutes of the current time.

9
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.730
If you do a restore,

10
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.190
it's going to restore to a new database cluster.

11
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.400
So automated backups just like RDS, if you restore,

12
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.720
they restore to a new database.

13
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.120
Now, you have Aurora backtracking,

14
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.630
and this is used to rewind the database

15
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.370
back and forth in time up to 72 hours.

16
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.460
Now, backtracking is different from backups

17
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.720
because backtracking does not create a new cluster,

18
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.110
it is an in-place restore,

19
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.390
and currently it supports Aurora MySQL only.

20
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.890
And then finally, you have Aurora database cloning,

21
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.520
in which case you're going to create a new database cluster

22
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.960
that will use the same DB cluster volume

23
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.510
as the original cluster in the beginning,

24
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.180
but then it's going to use the copy-on-write protocol,

25
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.520
which is that as the data is being written,

26
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.720
is going to be copied to a new volume.

27
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.920
And so that makes your Aurora data base cloning

28
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.930
super quick and super easy.

29
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.560
And so when do you use the database cloning?

30
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.540
Well, you use the database cloning

31
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.660
when you want to create a test environment

32
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.530
using a production data, for example.

33
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.010
It's one click, and there you go,

34
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.560
you can access a fully new environment,

35
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.160
which is quite handy, okay?

36
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.450
So that's it for this theory lecture.

37
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.870
Just remember that backups

38
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.710
are restored to a new database cluster.

39
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.530
Backtracking is used to do in-place restores.

40
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.720
And database cloning is a very easy way

41
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.580
for you to get started with a second database cluster

42
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.400
using the same, the originating data.

43
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.000
So that's it for this lecture, I hope you liked it.

44
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.950
And I will see you in the next lecture.
