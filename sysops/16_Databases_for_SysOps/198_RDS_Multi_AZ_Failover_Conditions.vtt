<v Instructor>Okay, so just a very,</v>

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.770
very short theory lecture,

3
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.850
but what are the failover conditions for Multi AZ?

4
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:06.840
You need to remember them.

5
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.900
So the failover will happen from the primary DB

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.730
to the secondary DB

7
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.487
if there is a failure of the primary DB,

8
00:00:14.487 --> 00:00:17.789
or if the operating system of your primary DB

9
00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.620
is undergoing some software patching,

10
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.900
or if your primary DB becomes unreachable

11
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.740
due to loss of network of connectivity,

12
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.810
or if you modify your primary DB instance,

13
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.320
for example, you're changing the instance type,

14
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.880
or if it's busy and unresponsive,

15
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.250
if there's an underlying storage failure.

16
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.610
And you need to remember those, okay?

17
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.700
Because they can be tested on the exam.

18
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.170
So just need to make sure that you are on with it.

19
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.080
But they're quite natural.

20
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.490
And also, you will have,

21
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.820
if you have an AZ outage,

22
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.840
and obviously, it's going to failover

23
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.470
because it's Multi AZ,

24
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.800
or if you initiate a manual failover of the DB instance,

25
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.300
using the option named Reboot with failover.

26
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.133
So that's it.

27
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:58.966
That's all you need to know.

28
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.480
I will see you in the next lecture.
